Abstract: A personalized agent needs a user memory: a persistent model of who its user is. Today it is almost always text -- transcripts and captions retrieved by similarity. This serves the captionable half of a person ("my cat is named Bibi"), but discards the perceptual half no caption can hold: how a voice sounds, how a face reads across age and lighting, how tired someone sounds. We measure this loss across five modalities: a strong caption-based re-identifier recovers as little as 0.11 of a dedicated encoder's recall, collapsing toward chance on non-nameable signals.
We instead ground perceptual memory in the model, decomposing recall into two subproblems: a vision-language model grounds the referent in context (what and where), and a dedicated encoder extracts an identity key (who), stored as one inline token read by attention at generation with no external round-trip. Neither suffices alone -- the VLM identifies cross-age faces at only 0.54 recall where a face encoder reaches 0.81, and an ungrounded encoder recognizes a two-person-scene referent at 0.05 -- yet together they reach correct-region oracle (0.96), generalizing to multi-speaker audio and video. The recognition core is training-free: it reproduces the encoder's recall on any frozen model at O(1) registration cost. On PerceptMem (12 domains, 1,080 tasks) perceptual identity is capacity-limited while exact facts are binding-limited: identity belongs in a parametric bank, facts in a text store. The two memories compose cleanly: an agent with both can remember not only what its user said, but also what they are like.
