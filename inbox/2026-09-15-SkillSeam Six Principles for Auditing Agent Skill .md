Abstract: A folder of competent skills is not yet a reliable system. Skills rarely fail alone; they
fail at the seams of a collection. As an agent's skill library grows, procedures compete for
attention, aliases double-load, boundaries blur, and poorly sized skills turn routing errors
into task failures. We introduce SkillSeam, a method that audits the relationships through
which individual skill files become a system. It maps each collection-level principle to a
failure mechanism, its strongest observable, and a controlled perturbation test. From one
sealed skill system, SkillSeam perturbs six design principles: persistence gradient, system
coherence, regime gating, orthogonal coverage, flow, and granularity discipline. Crucially,
each principle is evaluated through the channel its failure mechanism predicts rather than
through accuracy alone. Flattening the persistence hierarchy increases loaded-skill tokens
by 60%; a dangling anchor raises total tokens by 64% and shifts accuracy by -3.1pp; with
skill count and context size held fixed, replacing an unrelated control with a synonymous
alias raises noncanonical routes from 0/32 to 15/32 and flips half of matched paraphrase
pairs; in a candidate-ownership audit, overlapping lanes raise reported ownership conflicts
from 0/16 to 14/16; bland triggers drive routing conflicts from 3/32 to 30/32 and inflate
loaded-skill tokens 3.7x; and one granularity mis-mix produces the largest accuracy drop,
-12.5pp. These outcomes turn six pieces of authoring advice into testable system properties
without treating every probe as confirmation. We release the byte-differenced variants, task
slices, rollups, and a one-screen design checklist so that other skill systems can measure
the same failure channels.
