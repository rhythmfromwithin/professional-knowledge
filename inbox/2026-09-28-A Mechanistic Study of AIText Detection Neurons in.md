Abstract: AI-generated text detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, yet the internal representations that drive these predictions remain poorly understood. We study which neurons in a frozen BERT-base-uncased encoder support AI-text detection, using the RAID benchmark across six generators spanning pure-base and instruction-tuned models. We apply the L1-to-L2 sparse-probing protocol of Gurnee et al. (2023) to all 9,216 CLS hidden-state dimensions (12 layers x 768), which we call neurons. The procedure recovers a stable set of under 1% of neurons per generator, consistent across folds and seeds; a probe restricted to that set retains most of the full-feature detection accuracy. Bidirectional activation patching confirms this set's causal relevance: in both directions it flips predictions an order of magnitude more often than size-matched random sets. Mean-ablating the same neurons leaves accuracy largely intact; the signal is therefore redundantly distributed. Cross-generator analysis reveals a bipartite structure: instruction-tuned generators concentrate 30-36% of stable neurons in BERT's final layer while both base generators fall below 14%, consistent with a layer-12 footprint of post-training alignment. Leave-one-family-out evaluation shows the selected neurons retain 86-94% of the full-feature ceiling on unseen generator families, so a detector can operate on a small fixed subspace without re-identifying neurons per generator.
