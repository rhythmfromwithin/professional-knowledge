Abstract: LLM-based agents for automated code repair have received significant attention in recent years from both research and software engineering practice perspectives. However, limited attention has been paid to patches that pass syntactic and functional verification but still retain or introduce security vulnerabilities. The aim of this research is to systematically identify and categorize such silent failures in LLM-based agentic code repair.
We conducted an empirical study using 1,030 valid execution traces produced by seven agent frameworks with GPT-4o-mini across two security-focused datasets, SecurityEval and CVEfixes. Through three iterations of qualitative coding and manual verification, 170 confirmed silent failures were identified. The key results are: (i) Three main categories of silent failures were identified: Omission, Introduction, and Inadequacy. Omission accounts for 48.2% of the confirmed failures, Introduction for 30.6%, and Inadequacy for 21.2%. (ii) Ten fine-grained failure codes were classified under these three categories, showing how agents omit required security controls, apply incomplete defenses, or introduce new vulnerabilities during repair. (iii) Current test-passing evaluation and LLM-based reviewer roles were insufficient to expose or intercept these failures in the confirmed cases. (iv) Similar insecure solutions appeared across different frameworks, suggesting possible shared model-, prompt-, or task-level influences, while single-agent and multi-agent systems showed different failure profiles.
The results of this study will assist researchers and practitioners in improving the evaluation of LLM-based agentic code repair and developing targeted verification methods that go beyond functional correctness and cover all generated artifacts.
