Abstract: Multimodal stroke recurrence prediction requires effective integration of heterogeneous clinical and imaging data, yet modality imbalance often causes models to over-rely on dominant modalities and underutilize complementary information. While self-supervised pretraining and selective parameter freezing are commonly employed to improve representation learning and fine-tuning stability, their effect on modality contributions and cross-modal behavior in multimodal medical models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether image pretraining on 3D CTA scans reduces modality imbalance and improves cross-modal integration for stroke recurrence prediction, a clinically critical task we recently addressed. To this end, two multimodal neural networks are pretrained in a self-supervised manner and subsequently fine-tuned using two distinct freezing strategies. Their performance and modality utilization are compared against both the baseline model from our previous work and models trained entirely from scratch in this study. Our results demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining enables more effective utilization of the multimodal image-tabular dataset, outperforming both the prior baseline and all non-pretrained models. Notably, the best-performing Vision Transformer based neural network successfully overcomes unimodal collapse. Synergy analysis reveals significant interactions between vision and both gender and CHD, suggesting clinically relevant patterns for stroke recurrence. Overall, our findings demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining and strategic fine-tuning support more balanced modality utilization and enable meaningful cross-modal interactions.
