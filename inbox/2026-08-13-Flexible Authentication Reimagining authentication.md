#### Rebuilding login and signup surfaced product insights, not just technical challenges. Here’s how we designed Flexible Authentication at the intersection of product intuition and technical architecture.

For Airbnb, logins at irregular intervals are normal. A guest books a trip in January and may not open the app again until summer. A host checks back only when a reservation comes in, and may be busy with other activities when it does. For a two-sided marketplace where a failed login means a lost booking, and lost revenue for both the guest and the host, long gaps between sessions are a structural challenge, not an edge case.

Our authentication system had grown organically over a decade, adding new login methods like Social Login, Email OTP, and Phone over time. We recognized that our users have diverse needs: many, such as hosts, use Airbnb daily, while others visit less frequently, when they are planning trips or traveling. To provide a seamless experience, we needed to ensure we were doing a great job supporting all of these usage patterns, helping users pick up exactly where they left off, regardless of how much time had passed or which device they were using.

In this blog post, we’ll walk through how we rebuilt Airbnb’s authentication flows using a new paradigm we call **Flexible Authentication**, and how each architectural decision was guided by insights into the user’s experience.

### Identify first then Challenge

The ‘Identify first then Challenge’ model was the product insight that reframed the project. Our old system treated authentication as a single question: can this person prove who they are? The real question is more nuanced: given the multiple aspects of the user session, what’s the *easiest* way for them to verify it?

A traveler in Brazil who registered with a phone number is better served by a WhatsApp one-time password (OTP) than by SMS, since WhatsApp penetration far exceeds SMS in this market. A returning host in South Korea is better served by their Naver login, the leading South Korean identity provider, than by their Google ID. The right challenge depends on the person and context.

Based on this insight, we adopted an **Identify first then Challenge** model that splits the flow into two distinct stages. First, the person tells us who they are, using whatever method they want. This may be an email address, phone number, or social login. Once we know which account they are trying to log in to, a configurable policy engine picks the challenge that is most likely to succeed. We lead with that challenge and offer all other options as fallbacks.

The policy engine can use all available aspects of the user session and the account they are logging into, including historical information, to pick the challenge most likely to succeed. We have only started to scratch the surface of optimizing this policy engine.

The key architectural decision is that **the client never decides which challenge to present**. The server makes that call, and the client renders whatever screen it receives. This separation lets us tune authentication strategy per-region without shipping new client code across the many devices Airbnb guests and hosts use. This has made experimentation much easier.

### Try another way

Our old system had a frustrating failure mode: if you couldn’t complete the challenge presented to you, you were stuck. Forgot your password? You could reset it, but the reset flow was its own journey with its own drop-off points. Couldn’t receive an SMS? Tough luck, go back and enter your email so you can try password login instead.

The product team articulated a principle that became a hard engineering requirement: **every authentication screen must offer an escape**. No dead ends. If someone can’t complete the primary challenge, they should always see a “try another way” option with all other options they can use to log in.

![Two mobile screens showing an SMS verification flow: the left screen displays a ‘Confirm it’s you’ prompt with a 6-digit code entry field, a numeric keypad, and a ‘Try another way’ button; the right screen shows a bottom sheet modal titled ‘Try another way’ with alternative verification options — get a code via email, get a code via phone call, or enter your password.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5iolor1vDVv3BRfHdshLgA.png)

Every challenge screen has a “Try another way” button that allows the user to select other challenges.

We built this as the **Challenge Picker**, a server-driven component that accompanies every challenge screen. The server returns not just the primary challenge but a ranked list of alternatives, ordered by predicted success rate for that person’s context. The ranking considers what the person has successfully used before, what methods are registered on their account, and what’s available on their platform. When someone taps “Try another way,” the flow doesn’t restart. It adapts.

### Moving faster than our client release cycles

This insight came from a pattern we kept seeing: we’d identify a potential authentication improvement, build it, then wait weeks for app review and rollout before we’re able to even start an experiment. For a flow as critical as login, that feedback cycle was unacceptable.

The solution was to make the authentication experience **fully server-driven**, with **the screen as the fundamental unit of abstraction**. Each step (identifier input, challenge, account picker, or error recovery) is a screen defined entirely by server response. The client is only required to serve as a thin renderer that knows how to display a set of screen types and send actions back, with no opinion about sequence, copy, or flow logic.

Because our screens are defined by a server-side schema, our clients (Web, iOS, and Android) can use automatically generated type definitions. This setup ensures engineers can catch mismatches between client code and server requirements immediately during development.

### Results

Our former approach had much of the authentication logic on the client. Airbnb supports nearly every client type that there is, so this approach presented many challenges, including anticipating various challenges and reproducing bugs reported across many different kinds of clients. So keeping authentication logic on the server was a big change for us, and it had many beneficial effects.

As we implemented this change, the first thing we noticed was how much code disappeared. By moving screen sequencing and flow logic to the server, our client state management became much simpler. Our transition to a server-driven model allowed us to not only remove client-side logic but also streamline design systems and server-side localization. Together, these initiatives drove a 60% reduction in code and a 100KB reduction in the web client bundle. A smaller bundle is its own win for people on slow connections and constrained devices, but the leaner client mattered most for what it let us do next.

That leanness bought velocity. When the rules that govern a flow live behind a server response rather than inside a shipped binary, changing them no longer requires on-app review and staggered rollout. In the three months since launch we’ve run **20+** experiments against the new flows, and for most that did not require client changes, the turnaround between an idea and a measured result collapsed from weeks to days. We achieved considerable success with the initial launch, and we have been able to iterate quickly on new ideas and changes since them.

The numbers we care about most here are the ones people feel. Time to login has dropped significantly as the flow now leads with the challenge most likely to succeed, instead of one we’d hard-coded in advance. With fewer dead ends, and with a fallback always within reach, the share of visitors who successfully authenticated has risen by 2.6%, from an already high base, which is an improvement that affects millions of sessions. Outages that prevent one challenge from working no longer block users, because they can easily find alternatives.

Because more returning people find their way back into their existing account, the rate of duplicate accounts has fallen by 27%, which keeps trip history and reservations intact across sessions. And as more of those journeys are resolved through challenges a person can actually complete, we send fewer one-time SMS codes, cutting OTP costs by roughly 11%. None of these changes happened in isolation; a faster, more forgiving flow is the same flow that reaches more people, fragments fewer accounts, and spends less in doing so.

### Conclusion

There’s a constant flow of new devices and potential new ways to authenticate, and we are always looking for ways to make authentication easier. So Flexible Authentication is a framework for continuous product improvement, not a finished product.

The broader lesson for teams building authentication at global scale is that product insights and engineering architecture aren’t separate concerns. Identify-then-Challenge, the Challenge Picker, and server-driven screens are each direct expressions of our beliefs about how people behave when they’re trying to log in. The architecture’s flexibility, namely its ability to adapt per-region, per-experiment, and eventually per-person, comes from giving the server authority over decisions the client used to make. That pattern generalizes: for any flow where context determines the right experience, moving the decision boundary off the client unlocks the iteration speed needed to act on what you learn.
