Abstract: Prior work has shown that transformers can perform exact Bayesian filtering within a fixed
hypothesis class. Can they also perform Bayesian model selection -- identifying the correct
hypothesis class from data? We introduce model-selection Bayesian wind tunnels: controlled
environments where ground-truth posteriors over hypothesis classes are available in closed
form. Using fixed-point-free involutions -- whose defining property f(f(x))=x is purely
relational -- a 2.8M-parameter transformer achieves 0.01-bit entropy agreement with the
Bayesian optimum (3 seeds), with both integer tokens and opaque symbols whose meanings
change every episode. This extends to non-nested comparisons: involutions vs. 3-cycles
(where neither class is a subset of the other) achieve class-posterior MAE under 0.001,
demonstrating genuine model selection beyond simplicity/subset bias. We then identify a
sharp perceptual access condition: when the discriminative statistic requires arithmetic --
modular addition (rotations) or multiplication (f(x)=cx mod p) -- model selection succeeds
with integer tokens but fails completely with opaque symbols, and this boundary persists
under 112x scaling (2.8M to 316M parameters). A stationarity control confirms the operative
factor: opaque tokens with a fixed relabeling succeed (0.009-bit MAE), showing that stable
semantics, not integer identity, enable circuit compilation. Header subtask diagnostics
localize the failure to the composition of header inversion with arithmetic rather than
header parsing itself. Probing frontier LLMs on the same tasks shows qualitative Bayesian
behavior but a large calibration gap (~55x), measured through lossy probes and therefore
directional rather than exact.
