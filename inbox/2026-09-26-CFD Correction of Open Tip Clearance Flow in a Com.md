Abstract: CFD predictions of open tip clearance flow in compressor cascades are subject to discrepancies relative to experiments, while experimental observations are sparse and high-resolution experimental ground truth is unavailable. This study proposes a non-intrusive correction method based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) and latent-space adaptation. A VAE is first trained using a dataset of 166 parametrically sampled CFD total pressure loss fields to learn a low-dimensional statistical representation of these fields. The VAE is then frozen, and a low-rank latent-space adapter is trained using only 12 paired CFD--experiment operating conditions. An observation operator maps the corrected high-resolution fields to the experimental observation space, allowing supervision to be applied only at the available measurement locations and within the measured pitchwise windows. In the current 12-fold cross-validation, the mean absolute error decreases from 0.1335 to 0.0473, the root mean square error from 0.1717 to 0.0621, and the relative $L\_2$ error from 0.5108 to 0.1871. These results indicate that the method improves agreement between CFD predictions and sparse experimental observations of open tip clearance flow without modifying the RANS solver or constructing artificial high-resolution experimental labels.
