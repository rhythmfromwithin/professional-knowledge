Abstract: Data-driven MoCap-to-radar models generate plausible micro-Doppler spectrograms, but do they actually learn the underlying physics? We introduce a physics-based interpretability framework to answer this question via two proposed complementary metrics: one measures alignment between model predictions and the physics-derived Doppler frequency, while the other tests whether predictions preserve the velocity-frequency relationship under velocity intervention. Both metrics require only MoCap input and model predictions, without access to measured radar data. Experiments across several model architectures reveal that low reconstruction error does not guarantee physical consistency: some, but not all, models achieve low error yet perform poorly on the two physics-based metrics. Further analysis shows that temporal attention is critical for transformer-based models to learn the underlying physics.
