Abstract: Robots trained on real world data tend to be imprecise, slow, and brittle to perturbations. Improving these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) is an appealing alternative, but this process often requires expensive training in the real world. Performing policy improvement in simulation instead provides a far cheaper alternative, but unconstrained RL in simulation can exploit contact and dynamics mismatches, resulting in unsafe behaviors that do not transfer to hardware. Common forms of regularization can furthermore limit improvement by overconstraining to an imperfect behavior prior. In this work, we propose Support-Constrained Off-Domain REinforcement (SCORE), a real-to-sim-to-real framework that constrains RL in simulation to the support of a generative policy pretrained on real data. We instantiate this constraint through flow steering, restricting SCORE to actions the base policy can already produce, which ensures transferable behaviors while maximizing policy improvement. Improving a policy with SCORE requires minimal effort: it learns from sparse rewards, avoids distillation, and leaves the base policy untouched. Across eight real-world dexterous multi-fingered robotic manipulation tasks, SCORE improves average success rate from 37.8% to 89.9%, compared to 59.5% for the best baseline, and reaches success in 36.8% fewer steps than the base policy. Ultimately, through extensive experiments and ablations, we show that simulation can substantially improve real-world manipulation policies when policy optimization is appropriately constrained, introducing a new paradigm for real-to-sim-to-real policy improvement.
