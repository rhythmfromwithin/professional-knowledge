Abstract: In X-ray CT, metallic objects cause beam hardening, photon starvation, and scattering, leading to projection inconsistency, streaks, dark bands, and structural distortions that compromise clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis. Existing metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods remain limited: optimization-based methods may leave residual artifacts or blur structures, regression networks may generalize poorly across scenarios, and generative models without sample-specific structural guidance and physical constraints may produce anatomically inconsistent structures. Flow Matching learns a continuous-time velocity field that deterministically transports a source distribution to a target distribution, providing a flexible MAR prior. However, standard unconditional Flow Matching does not exploit sample-specific structure, spatially nonuniform metal-induced degradation, or measured projections. To address these limitations, we propose SCMA, a structure-conditioned and metal-aware Flow Matching framework. First, a linear-interpolation-corrected image is fed into the velocity network with the intermediate state as a sample-specific structural condition, guiding inference toward artifact-free CT images while preserving anatomy. Second, time-varying spatial weights from the metal mask and its distance transform are incorporated into the Flow Matching loss to emphasize severe degradation within and around metal regions. Finally, conditional Flow Matching updates alternate with projection-consistency correction during inference, allowing reliable measurements outside metal traces to constrain predictions. Experiments on simulated and real CT data demonstrate that SCMA more effectively suppresses metal artifacts, preserves local anatomical structures, and reduces hallucination-like structures inconsistent with projection measurements than representative MAR methods.
