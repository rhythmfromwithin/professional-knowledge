Abstract: In Model-Based Testing (MBT), test suites are generated automatically from a formal specification. The theory of testing real-time systems is rich, but often underused in practice, partly because applying the timed machinery demands expertise practitioners should not need. In prior work we addressed this for timed testing with a canonic lifting operator, which lets a modeller specify behaviour as plain labelled transition systems while implicitly obtaining the timed automata that express their quiescent behaviour (the explicit absence of outputs) with timers. This paper takes the next step: we show that our lifting still works when each component carries its own time-out on its own channel. This way, we introduce a multi-channel lifting. We show that it commutes with parallel composition, i.e. composing and lifting is the same as lifting first and then composing. We show that the MBT apparatus survives: conformance, test generation and verdicts are preserved by the lifting, on the testable traces that a time-out based tester can observe.
