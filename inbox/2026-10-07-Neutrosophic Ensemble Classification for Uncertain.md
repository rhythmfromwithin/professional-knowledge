Abstract: Machine learning classifiers for bearing fault detection produce scalar confidence scores that conflate confident errors with genuinely ambiguous predictions, and the conventional truth/falsity pair (F = 1 - T) is algebraically redundant by construction. We operationalize a refined neutrosophic decomposition of a Random Forest + XGBoost + Logistic Regression ensemble into four indicators -- T-hat (top-class evidence), F-hat (best-competitor evidence), predictive entropy I1-hat, and decision disagreement I2-hat -- evaluated on two bearing benchmarks (CWRU and JNU, 600-1000 rpm) under a leave-one-condition-out protocol. On CWRU, after correcting a file-to-class mapping error, the ensemble reaches 100.00 percent accuracy on three of four held-out loads (92.27 percent on the fourth), leaving too few errors for uncertainty analysis. On JNU, holding out 1000 rpm, accuracy collapses to 40.64 percent, below a majority-class baseline; Logistic Regression (57.91 percent) generalizes far better than the tree ensembles. I1-hat shows a robust association with error beyond T-hat/F-hat, while I2-hat contributes little; standalone Logistic Regression confidence outperforms the full decomposition, a boundary condition we report honestly. Two further results extend this: fusing a time-domain and a frequency-domain model of the same signal and scoring their Jensen-Shannon divergence beats that model own entropy (AURC 0.29 vs. 0.36 on the standard split; 0.54 vs. 0.73 under a harder single-condition reproduction), the only indicator moving correctly under a CWRU-versus-JNU distributional-shift contrast; and, on CWRU alone, literature-verified bearing fault frequencies, correctly demodulated via the envelope spectrum, separate most fault classes almost perfectly (99.57 percent) using three interpretable features. Code, logs, and figures are released for independent verification.
