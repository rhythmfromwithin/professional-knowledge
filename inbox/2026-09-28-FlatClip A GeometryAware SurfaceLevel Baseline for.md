Abstract: Recent fMRI foundation models differ substantially in the spatial scale at which they represent brain activity. ROI- and connectivity-based models are efficient but coarse, whereas voxel-level models preserve fine-grained spatial structure but require specialized 3D/4D architectures and costly fMRI-specific pretraining. We ask how effectively an image-pretrained encoder can reuse the spatial organization of cortical activity. Motivated by evidence that macroscale brain activity is strongly constrained by brain geometry, we introduce FlatClip, a frozen-encoder surface-level baseline that renders cortical activity as geometry-aware flatmap sequences and reuses a frozen SigLIP2 image encoder with only a lightweight downstream probe. Across resting-state benchmarks, FlatClip serves as a competitive middle-ground representation, outperforming ROI-level baselines on HCP and ADNI tasks while remaining weaker on PPMI and below the strongest voxel-level models overall. On visual-fMRI decoding, restricting the input to visual or NSD-provided task-active cortex improves performance, highlighting the value of task-relevant cortical coverage. Spatial perturbation controls reduce the predictive performance of flatmap features under both retrained and fixed readouts, and anatomy-linked arrangements consistently outperform vertex permutations across three colormaps. Together, these results position surface-level flatmap sequences as a practical middle-ground baseline between ROI and voxel models, and support the utility of anatomy-linked spatial organization for reusing image-pretrained features.
