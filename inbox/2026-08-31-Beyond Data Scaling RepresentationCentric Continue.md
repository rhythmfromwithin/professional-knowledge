Abstract: Scaling robot data is crucial for building generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet robot trajectories are harder to scale than web-scale image-text data because embodied collection is costly and sparsely covers the physical world. This makes representation quality a central bottleneck: under a fixed robot-data budget, continued pre-training must turn limited trajectories into transferable visual-action knowledge rather than merely fit actions. We propose VLAct, a VLA-oriented VLM backbone trained on broad, heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data before task-specific fine-tuning. VLAct preserves the broad VLM prior and encourages shared action semantics across embodiments through VLM-prior preservation, multi-head continuous action co-supervision, and a partially unified cross-embodiment action layout, while allowing task-specific action heads during fine-tuning. Across simulation, real-world, and unseen-embodiment transfer, VLAct consistently improves downstream performance under fixed fine-tuning protocols. On LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin 2.0, VLAct surpasses industrial VLA systems including ABot-M0 and LingBot-VLA, achieving success rates of 82.6% and 92.5%. On RoboDojo, VLAct ranks sixth among all policies by success rate and outperforms all explicitly designated world-action model (WAM) entries on both metrics. Most notably, on RoboCasa-GR1, an unseen humanoid embodiment, VLAct using only 20% of downstream trajectories outperforms the full-data GR00T-N1.6 baseline. These results are obtained using fully open-source data and only a 16-GPU training setup, showing that representation-centric continued pre-training can deliver highly competitive performance under a modest compute budget and is an important independent axis of VLA progress beyond data scaling.
