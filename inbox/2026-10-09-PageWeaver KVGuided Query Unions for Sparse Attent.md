Abstract: Dynamic sparse attention limits the KV pages selected by each query, but a small support does not necessarily yield efficient GPU work. Query unions share page loads and populate Tensor Core tiles; their cost depends on which queries are grouped together. We present PageWeaver, an execution design that uses selected-page affinity to assemble query groups while preserving each query's original support and complete output ownership. A bounded GPU search produces query IDs, and an ID-aware two-CTA kernel consumes them without materializing reordered Q tensors or cross-page partial outputs. A direct KV-page union implementation provides a complementary design study of nonlocal reuse and reduction cost. With FP8 KV throughout, the H200 Union8 implementation achieves a 1.70x geometric-mean complete-call speedup over the measured FlashInfer path on six captures. Online regrouping further lowers latency by 3.26-7.66% on five selected 64K-context captures. Whole-model prefill throughput is 7.88-14.36% above the tested native path; the incremental regrouping benefit is smaller, with observed median gains of 0.47-0.73% at 32K/64K and regressions at 8K. A B300 comparison identifies cases where preparation cost and a stronger native kernel remove the advantage. These results separate execution-group reuse from the complete cost of exploiting it online.
