Abstract: A fixed network of McCulloch-Pitts threshold units with weights in {-1,0,1} can hold other threshold networks in its state and run them: the state is a ring of banks of records, each record a unit of a stored network, and each step evaluates one record. We use such a network to carry out von Neumann's universal construction and self-reproduction exactly. As a cellular automaton keeps its rule, the fixed network keeps its weights, and what reproduces is a stored network. A constructor of 143 records reads the description of a network from its tape, builds that network in the next bank, copies the description onto the next tape and hands control to what it built; started on its own description, it rebuilds itself, weights included, in every generation. The scheme scales to a universal computer. A SUBLEQ computer of 17,598 ternary units, stored as 36,080 records and running a program of 27 instructions, builds any network that fits a bank and reproduces itself in the same way, at every word width from eight bits on; run directly, it emits the serialization of its own weights, memory and tape. Integer pre-activations give every orbit a margin of 1/2, and replicating each unit r times multiplies it by r. That suffices against noise of any size on the pre-activations, but against von Neumann's output flips only below a threshold inversely proportional to the fan-in. These results are proved in Rocq.
