Abstract: Reliable image quality assessment is essential in applications where large volumes of images are acquired automatically and must be filtered before further analysis. In many practical scenarios, a pristine reference image is unavailable, making no reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) particularly important. This paper introduces Multi-Metric Image Quality Assessment (MM-IQA), a lightweight multi-metric framework for NR-IQA. It combines interpretable cues related to blur, edge structure, low resolution artifacts, exposure imbalance, noise, haze, and frequency content to produce a single quality score in the range [0,100].MM-IQA was evaluated on five benchmark datasets (KonIQ-10k, LIVE Challenge, KADID-10k, TID2013, and BIQ2021) and achieved SRCC values ranging from 0.647 to 0.830. Additional experiments on a synthetic agricultural dataset showed consistent behavior of the designed cues. The Python/OpenCV implementation required about 1.97 s per image. This method also has modest memory requirements because it stores only a limited number of intermediate grayscale, filtered, and frequency-domain representations, resulting in memory usage that scales linearly with image size. The results show that MM-IQA can be used for fast image quality screening with explicit distortion aware cues and modest computational cost.
