Abstract: Automated photogrammetric inspection emits metric measurements from reconstructions whose correctness is normally unknown without an external survey. Can a reconstruction estimate its own reliability with no ground truth, and what would such an estimate measure? We formalise a track-leakage-free hold-out protocol: a deterministic image subset is withheld, and each withheld view is re-localised by resection against only those 3D points supported by at least two retained images, so no view is tested against structure it helped create. We evaluate it on five GNSS-referenced captures (four RTK-fixed) across four sites, 13 ETH3D laser-scan scenes, a EuRoC flight, and 30 IMC 2025 scenes. The protocol is computationally well-posed -- good reconstructions score near-perfect self-consistency (median rotation error 0.003 deg) -- but it does not measure accuracy, for a structural rather than statistical reason. It saturates: confidence stays pinned at 1.00 while true error swings 14.1x within a single capture, and holds at 1.00 on survey-grade truth at 3.4 m, 4.3 m, and 1.7 m / 13 deg. It is blind to coherent distortion: corruption that fragments a reconstruction is caught (1.00 -> 0.96), but corruption yielding a single, internally self-consistent, globally distorted model is not -- at three of four captures such models were wrong by 55-106 m at confidence 1.00. On IMC 2025 the same dichotomy appears with no injected degradation: confidence separates failed from successful reconstructions (rho = 0.68) yet ranks nothing among the successful ones (rho = 0.01). A capture-level meta-analysis of the continuous signal is underpowered and sign-unstable (k = 5, 95% CI [-0.45, +0.75]); the negative result does not rest on it. Track-leakage-free hold-out therefore measures internal geometric consistency: a qualitative fragmentation warning, not a substitute for control-point accuracy assessment.
