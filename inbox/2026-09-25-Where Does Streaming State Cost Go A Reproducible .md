Abstract: This paper presents a controlled comparison of exactly-once Kafka pipelines implemented with Apache Flink and Kafka Streams, two engines with different state-management architectures. The state management in Flink occurs through checkpoints in external storage, whereas Kafka Streams restores local state by replaying broker changelogs. The experiments evaluate the effects of the two designs on latency, resource consumption, configuration sensitivity, and recover from injected failures. The engines produced expected outputs across 50 correctness trials, five for each engine-workload combination (exact 95% CI 0.929-1.000). The latencies, however, showed differences when tested in 30 minute trials at a fixed rate of 100 events/sec. The measured ingestion to output interval was 4-6 ms for stateless workloads and 4.3-6.2 s for windowed workloads. The median p99 was 1.97-1.97s for stateless workloads and 5.68-9.92s for windowed respectively. Further, a sensitivity study showed that increasing the durability interval from 1,000 to 10,000 ms shifted the latency distributions in Kafka Streams and Flink between stages. Kafka Streams' W3 median p99 T2-T1 increased from 6,085 to 23,155 ms; Flink's T3-T2 increased from 732 to 8,702 ms. Failure injection experiments demonstrate that latency can interfere with incomplete processing behavior. The results show that exactly-once correctness is a necessary but insufficient measure of stream processing performance. Kafka Streams completed 0/5 stateful JVM-kill and 1/5 in each stateful local-volume-loss trials, while corresponding Flink cells completed 5/5. The cost, placement and magnitude depend on state management, architecture, configuration, and measurement location. Accordingly, evaluations of fault-tolerant streaming systems should holistically measure latency, completion, recovery behavior, and correctness.
