Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) must identify real threats from large alert streams, but limited analyst capacity means that unnecessary escalations can delay more serious investigations. Existing studies often frame SOC alert triage as classification or anomaly detection, but both views are incomplete for production SOCs, where the central problem is selecting alerts worth escalating under limited capacity, asymmetric error costs, and workload constraints. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing alert triage as a constrained decision problem and evaluating three approaches: an offline reinforcement learning policy trained on alert embeddings, an Isolation Forest model built on operational features, and an autoencoder trained on historical benign alerts. These methods represent different triage assumptions: learning actions from reward, isolating unusual operational patterns, and detecting deviations from benign behavior. We evaluate all methods on 74,909 analyst-labeled production alerts under a strict temporal split and benign-escalation constraint. Because the test set contains 503 unique feature patterns, we primarily rank clusters of similar alerts. At the main operating point, all three methods satisfy the constraint, with the reinforcement learning policy achieving the lowest benign-escalation fraction at 0.000, compared with 0.007 for the autoencoder and 0.041 for Isolation Forest. The methods also prioritize largely different alert clusters, showing complementary rather than redundant coverage. These results suggest that production SOC triage can benefit from constraint-aware evaluation and combined or adaptive deployment of different model families.
