Abstract: Existing document OCR largely targets plain text or Markdown, discarding the structural and executable properties that make LaTeX essential for scientific publishing. We study page-level reconstruction of scientific PDFs into compilable LaTeX and introduce TexOCR-Bench, a benchmark, and TexOCR-Train, a large-scale training corpus, for this task. TexOCR-Bench features a multi-dimensional evaluation suite that jointly assesses transcription fidelity, structural faithfulness, and end-to-end compilability. Leveraging TexOCR-Train, we train a 2B-parameter model, TexOCR, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards derived from LaTeX unit tests that directly enforce compilability and referential integrity. Experiments across 21 frontier models on TexOCR-Bench show that existing systems frequently violate key document invariants, including consistent section structure, correct float placement, and valid label-reference links, which undermines compilation reliability and downstream usability. Our analysis further reveals that RL with verifiable rewards yields consistent improvements over SFT alone, particularly on structural and compilation metrics.
