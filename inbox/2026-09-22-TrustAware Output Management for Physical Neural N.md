Abstract: Physical Neural Networks (PNNs) introduce new opportunities for cloud continuum computing, but their outputs may be affected by noise, drift, delay, and incomplete reliability information. Existing substrate-management approaches mainly focus on discovery, invocation, and monitoring, while the reliability of the returned output is often left unaddressed. This paper proposes a trust-aware output management framework for heterogeneous PNNs. Each output is represented with quality and context information, and a lightweight edge-level trust score decides whether it should be accepted, rejected, or forwarded to the fog. At the fog layer, compatible outputs are checked for disagreement and combined using reliability- and uncertainty-aware fusion. Historical trust is also tracked to detect sustained degradation and support recalibration requests. The framework is evaluated using controlled and randomized PNN output models. Across 20 random seeds, the proposed full-trust policy reduces unsafe acceptance from approximately 61.5\% for raw output handling to about 5.0\%, while accepted-output MAE decreases from 0.504 to 0.242. Risk coverage analysis shows that this improvement is not explained only by lower local acceptance. The proposed fog fusion method also achieves the lowest aggregate mean error among the evaluated methods, with a small but consistent advantage over strong uncertainty-aware baselines. The prototype adds about $2~\mu\text{s}$ of edge processing per evidence record. These results show that post-invocation reliability management can improve the safe use of PNN outputs across edge--fog--cloud systems.
