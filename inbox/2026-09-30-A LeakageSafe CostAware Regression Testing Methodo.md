Abstract: Quantum SDKs such as Qiskit are revised continually, and a single transpiler-pass change can introduce a software regression, so continuous integration (CI) must select and prioritize tests from a large, cost-heterogeneous suite under a fixed budget. We present a leakage-safe, cost-aware regression-test-selection methodology for the Qiskit quantum transpiler, with a pre-registered, budget binding evaluation that avoids data leakage. The evaluation uses a cost-heterogeneous corpus (116 units, per-unit cost spread 9,945X, T\_full = 69.17 s) whose budgets were fixed from measured cost before any test-oracle label was read. A transparent risk\_score selector does not beat simple test case-prioritization baselines: mean detection-vs-budget AUC is 0.721 [95% CI 0.44, 0.94] versus 0.874 [0.65, 1.00] for diversity-only (Cliff's {\delta} = -0.64, large), with cost/history/change-stage baselines at 0.840 and random at 0.821. A component ablation shows the composite underperforms its own best signal: diversity and novelty, not severity or cost, are the effective signal. A second, independently pre-registered evaluation (19 mutation-testing events: nine original plus ten new, verified operators) tests the decomposed, diversity-first selector this mechanism implies: it closes the gap to the strongest baseline to a negligible effect size (0.880 vs 0.880, {\delta} = -0.08) while decisively beating the original composite (0.880 vs 0.768, {\delta} = +0.57). Two verified forward-regression events from real Qiskit CI history corroborate it, reported per event, not pooled, under a pre-declared claim-scope rule. We report the negative result as an honest, pre-registered finding with its mechanism. All code, data, and artifacts from this empirical software engineering study are released for reproducibility.
