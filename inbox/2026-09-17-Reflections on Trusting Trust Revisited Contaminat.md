Abstract: Thompson's "Reflections on Trusting Trust" showed that a compiler can be poisoned to reinsert its own backdoor, so that even recompiling clean source reproduces the Trojan. Today, substantial coding work is done by AI coding agents -- and increasingly, those agents generate new versions of themselves. We reconsider Thompson's attack when the "compiler" is a self-modifying coding agent. Can an adversary supply poisoned benchmarks to the agent's self-evaluation and self-improvement process to induce future versions of the agent to write vulnerable code on clean, held-out tasks? We instantiate this attack against three recently proposed self-modifying coding agents: the Darwin G\"odel Machine (with our experimental modifications), the Self-Improving Coding Agent, and Hyperagents (both substantively unmodified). We demonstrate successful proofs-of-concept: for example, with Hyperagents powered by Sonnet 4.5, our poisoned benchmark leads the agent to self-evolve instructions that disable HTTPS certificate validation on neutral URL-fetching tasks. From our experiments, we distill properties of the vulnerability, benchmark, model, and agent scaffolding that are sufficient to enable a benchmark poisoning attack. Moreover, we show that contamination often persists even when a poisoned agent is subsequently evolved against clean benchmarks. We discuss defensive directions and argue that self-modifying coding agents must be designed to be more resilient to such attacks.
