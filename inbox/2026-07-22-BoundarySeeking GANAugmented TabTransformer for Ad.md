Abstract: Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) often suffer from class imbalance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks, leading to degraded detection performance and reduced robustness. This study proposes a TabTransformer framework augmented by the Boundary-Seeking Generative Adversarial Network (BGAN) for flow-based intrusion detection using the CICIDS2017 dataset. BGAN serves a dual purpose by generating synthetic minority-class samples to mitigate data imbalance and producing adversarial samples to evaluate model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that BGAN augmentation improves TabTransformer's Macro-F1 score from 82.96% to 86.50%, with the largest class-wise improvement observed for Web\_Attack (F1 score: 0.29 to 0.61). Robustness evaluation shows that all non-augmented models experienced a 100% Performance Drop Rate (PDR) under adversarial testing, whereas all BGAN-augmented models achieved negative PDR values, indicating improved resilience. Furthermore, the augmented TabTransformer maintained stable and low False Triggered Rate (FTR) values (1.51%-2.92%) across all noise levels, compared with the BGAN-augmented Decision Tree, which reached 49.09% under benign perturbations. These findings demonstrate that BGAN consistently enhances both class balance and adversarial robustness, while the proposed BGAN-TabTransformer framework provides an effective and adaptive intrusion detection solution for adversarial network environments.
