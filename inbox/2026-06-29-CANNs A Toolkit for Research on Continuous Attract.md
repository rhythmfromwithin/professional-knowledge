Abstract: Continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) are the canonical computational framework for how the brain encodes continuous variables such as spatial position, head direction, and movement direction, and explain the activity of hippocampal place cells, entorhinal grid cells, and head-direction cells. CANN research, however, is fragmented: most results rest on lab-specific implementations, general-purpose simulators lack CANN-specific abstractions, and the path from spike trains to attractor geometry in real recordings lacks a standardized toolkit. Here, we present a comprehensive open-source toolkit that unifies the full CANN research workflow. It combines three tightly integrated components: 1) canns, a Python library on BrainPy/JAX that provides standardized 1D/2D CANNs, spike-frequency-adaptation variants, grid cell networks, hierarchical path-integration models, and brain-inspired attractor architectures, together with curated datasets, task generators, an analyzer module and trainer modules for biologically plausible plasticity; 2) canns-lib, a Rust acceleration backend delivering hundreds-of-times speedups for spatial-navigation workloads and modest gains for Ripser-based persistent homology; 3) ASA (Attractor Structure Analyzer), a PySide6 pipeline applying persistent homology and cohomology to experimental neural recordings to detect ring-like and toroidal attractor signatures in real data. The toolkit ships with full-detail reproducible pipelines that recover recent CANN results including SFA-driven anticipative tracking, theta sweeps in head-direction/place/grid systems, and hierarchical path integration.
