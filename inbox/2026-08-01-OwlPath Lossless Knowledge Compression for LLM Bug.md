Abstract: LLM-based software engineering agents are constrained by limited context windows: roughly 100K tokens must store structurally relevant code subsets to resolve bugs. Standard retrieval models treat code as plain text, forcing agents to resolve multi-hop dependencies including subclass chains, transitive callers and interface implementations through slow trial and error. We tackle this limitation with lossless knowledge compression, encoding source code into an OWL2 ontology to answer structural queries using minimal relevant code fragments.
We present OwlPath, an OWL2 reasoning layer atop CodeGraph, a widely used code intelligence platform with 500K+ GitHub stars, offering a unified CLI for structural code retrieval. Powered by tree-sitter parsing, OwlPath supports multi-language repositories (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, etc.) and encodes language-specific semantics into a unified OWL2 ontology. It adopts two complementary modules. First, a transitive-closure engine fetches all structurally linked symbols via single SPARQL property-path queries, capturing multi-hop relations missed by string matching. Second, the OWL Software Knowledge Map (OWL-SKM) precomputes a compact 3KB summary with module trees, core APIs and issue-related symbols, directing agents to target modules in the first query.
Evaluated on 18 SWE-bench Pro instances, OwlPath obtains a 68.4% strict-apply rate versus 66.7% for the CodeGraph baseline, cutting token usage by 28.8% and runtime by 39.5%. In offline retrieval tests over 67 instances, OwlPath improves recall 2.06 times (0.464 vs 0.226) and reaches 88.1% hit rate compared to CodeGraph's 59.7%. On a 37-question structural retrieval benchmark, recall rises from 4.4% to 28.8%, with 69-80% accuracy on transitive caller and interface tasks.
