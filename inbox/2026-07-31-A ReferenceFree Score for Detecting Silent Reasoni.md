Abstract: Mathematical chain of thought (CoT) evaluation is commonly reduced to whether the final answer matches a reference. This conflates producing a correct conclusion with producing a valid derivation an invalid chain can accidentally reach the right answer, while a valid calculation can be followed by a transcription error. We call this mismatch the reasoning answer consistency gap. This framework paper introduces the Reasoning Answer Faithfulness Score (RAFS), a reference free, instance level diagnostic of whether an emitted mathematical trace is locally credible, supports its answer, and is stable under resampling and targeted counterfactual interventions. RAFS combines step validity, reasoning to answer entailment and counterfactual sensitivity, answer consensus, and conditional reasoning stability. It evaluates transcript level agreement, not a models private computation and not factual correctness outside the tested mathematical setting. We retain a preregistered, results blind confirmatory study on GSM8K and MATH, with hypotheses, admissibility rules, calibration, and tests fixed before confirmatory outcomes are inspected. A separate feasibility pilot is specified to verify end to end execution and estimate interven tion coverage before that freeze numerical pilot claims are re ported only when trace level artifacts are available. We formalize four reasoning answer outcomes, justify the non compensatory aggregator, instantiate semantic trace distance, quantify compute and abstention tradeoffs, and define verifier independence and power analyses. RAFS is intended to complement mathematical answer accuracy with an auditable warning signal for silent reasoning failures and answer extraction errors
