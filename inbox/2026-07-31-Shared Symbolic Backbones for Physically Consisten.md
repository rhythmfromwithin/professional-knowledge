Abstract: Symbolic regression provides analytical expressions, but it is usually applied one output at a time. This is limiting in process systems, where state variables are often coupled through shared physical parameters. Independent symbolic regression can give accurate individual equations that are difficult to interpret as one model. We present a neuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method for coupled multi-output systems. The method searches for a shared symbolic backbone: a set of latent symbolic units that is discovered once and reused by several outputs through sparse additive or multiplicative read-outs. The discrete model structure is evolved by mutation and crossover, whereas the continuous parameters are tuned by gradient descent and inherited by the offspring. The method is assessed on a set of benchmarks with known ground truth and on a hydrothermal liquefaction yield case. The results show that coupling is not a general route to lower prediction error. Its main contribution is the enforcement and diagnosis of cross-output consistency when a physically shared factor is embedded in a latent expression and is weakly identifiable from the data. This occurs for Langmuir-Hinshelwood and site-coverage denominators, for which independent PySR does not close the consistency gap or recover the same shared form. Conversely, when each output is already identifiable, as in the Van de Vusse benchmark, independent symbolic regression matches or improves the coupled model. The proposed framework, rather than a general purpose predictor, is a structured shared-mechanism extractor. Its value is highest when the target structure is sparse, shared, weakly identifiable or constrained by closure.
