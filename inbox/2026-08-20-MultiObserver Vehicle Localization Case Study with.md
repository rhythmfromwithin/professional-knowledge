Abstract: In modern intelligent transportation systems, it is essential to accurately estimate vehicle positions, especially in mixed traffic conditions where both connected and conventional vehicles coexist. Roadside infrastructure and connected vehicles can provide complementary observations of the same traffic scene, but real-world evidence on decision-level fusion between these sources remains limited. This paper proposes a multi-observer vehicle localization framework that fuses compact object-level detections from a static roadside radar and a dynamic LiDAR-equipped connected vehicle. We evaluate the framework with real-world data collected at an urban intersection in Helsinki, Finland, with a separately instrumented target vehicle used as the reference trajectory. Two extended Kalman filter based strategies for the localization task were benchmarked. The performance of the radar and LiDAR sensors were evaluated separately, and the two fusion strategies were explored under nominal sensing conditions, reduced LiDAR update rates, simulated LiDAR occlusions, and different target-vehicle motion states. The results show that, under full LiDAR availability, fusion performance is dominated by the LiDAR observations, while the less accurate and less consistent radar observations provide only limited additional improvement. Nevertheless, AEKF achieves small gains over the LiDAR-only baseline, and object-level connected vehicle observations remain useful when shared at reduced update rates. These findings indicate that decision-level fusion provides scenario-dependent benefits rather than automatic improvement over a strong single-sensor baseline. We release the dataset and implementation on Github to support further research: https://github.com/AppuriAalto/multi-observer-vehicle-tracking
