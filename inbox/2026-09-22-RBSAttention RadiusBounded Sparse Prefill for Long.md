Abstract: Long-context large language model inference is increasingly limited by prefill, where dense self-attention processes the entire prompt before generation begins. Sparse block selection can reduce this cost, but a block centroid may hide a highly relevant token among many irrelevant ones. We call this failure mode mean dilution and propose RBS-Attention, a training-free sparse-prefill method with two complementary selection branches. A centroid base branch captures average relevance, while a rescue branch uses the maximum key-block radius and its prompt-, layer-, and head-dependent distribution to identify blocks at risk of underestimation. Independently thresholding the two branches and combining their masks controls the contribution of rescue blocks while preserving regular block-sparse FlashAttention execution. On H100 GPUs, RBS-Attention achieves 20.65$\times$ standalone prefill-attention speedup, 11.92$\times$ vLLM prefill-attention speedup, and 5.97$\times$ end-to-end time-to-first-token speedup at 128K on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-FP8. On the dense Qwen3-32B model, it obtains 88.65 overall RULER accuracy versus 89.52 for dense attention; LongBench-v2, InfiniteBench, and Video-MME provide additional quality evaluation. Supporting experiments measure actual retention, compare selectors at matched density, and characterize block-size, threshold, and memory behavior. Together, these results support radius-adaptive dual-branch selection as an effective approach to long-context prefill.
