Abstract: Clinical time series are central to patient monitoring, risk assessment, and clinical decision support. However, they are often sparse, irregularly sampled, and asynchronous, making it difficult for models to identify the temporal evidence required for clinical Question Answering (QA). Existing benchmarks primarily focus on regularly sampled time-series QA or medical QA over static data, and therefore rarely assess whether models can faithfully ground their answers in irregular temporal observations. To fill this gap, we introduce CLIR-Bench, a benchmark for irregular clinical time series QA constructed from de-identified ICU records through a principled four-stage pipeline. CLIR-Bench contains 6,600 QA instances spanning 11 clinical variables, organized into four capability dimensions and 11 tasks. Each question is linked to explicit temporal evidence and task-specific answer derivation rules, enabling evaluation of both answer accuracy and evidence use. Experiments show that existing generalist models struggle to retrieve and reason over sparse clinical evidence, highlighting the need for stronger irregular time-series reasoning methods. Our code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/winall/CLIR-Bench.
