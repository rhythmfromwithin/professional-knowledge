Abstract: Safety validation of autonomous driving systems requires high-risk scenario coverage, clear collision semantics, executable trajectories, and attributable multi-vehicle interactions. Existing safety-critical scenario generation methods often rely on low-level trajectory perturbations, collision-proxy optimization, or single-adversary search, which may produce adversarial samples with ambiguous collision causes or uncontrolled multi-vehicle collisions. This paper proposes KG-ASG, a collision-knowledge-guided closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework with primary-support attribution. KG-ASG constructs a structured collision knowledge base and trains a lightweight Collision Expert to infer the target collision mode, the unique primary adversary, support vehicles, and their interaction roles. Guided by this semantic prior, multi-vehicle adversarial generation is formulated as a primary-support process, where the primary adversary induces the main conflict and support vehicles shape the surrounding risk structure without becoming additional colliders. Rule, physical, interaction-safety, and single-collider constraints are imposed as hard gates to filter non-executable samples. To handle reactive ego behaviors, planner-controller feedback is further used for failure diagnosis, candidate re-ranking, and terminal refinement. Experiments on WOMD scenarios reconstructed in MetaDrive show that KG-ASG achieves strong adversarial effectiveness while improving Valid Primary Attack, reducing multi-collision, and obtaining closed-loop recovery gains under IDM, Cruise, and Expert controllers. These results demonstrate that collision-knowledge guidance and primary-support single-collider reasoning improve adversarial effectiveness, interpretability, and executability for autonomous driving safety validation.
