Abstract: Every interaction between AI agents begins with a handshake: the initiating agent must locate its counterpart, learn what it can do, and establish a session before the first useful message can be sent. Surveys of agent communication protocols name handshake overhead as an efficiency criterion, yet none report measurements. This paper presents the first empirical, phase-decomposed benchmark of the handshake in three major agent protocols: MCP (in both its 2025 initialize and 2026 discover eras), A2A, and ACP. Using each protocol's official SDK, we instrument every request for round trips, per-phase latency, wire bytes, and token cost across cold-start, warm-repeat, capability-mismatch, and degraded-metadata scenarios (N=50 per cell, on loopback and under an emulated 50 ms RTT). Round-trip count dominates handshake cost. A legacy MCP handshake takes three round trips and 230 ms at 50 ms RTT; A2A needs one round trip and 61.0 ms. Round trips are not the whole bill: when an LLM reads the counterpart's metadata, handshake cost scales with the counterpart's capability inventory at 24-107 tokens per capability, so a 200-capability counterpart spends 11% of a 200k-token context window before the agent reads its own task. MCP's own 2026 revision cuts its handshake from three round trips to two and, with era pinning, to zero on warm reconnects, protocol evolution that corroborates the cost we measure. We release the full harness, raw data, and analysis at https://github.com/pvarshh/handshake-benchmark.
