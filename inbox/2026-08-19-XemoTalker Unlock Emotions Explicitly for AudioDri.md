Abstract: Precise emotion control in audio-driven talking heads remains a challenge due to the reliance on implicit emotion regulation in existing systems, which often leads to indirect and insufficient control. Additionally, training with explicit emotion-related losses across the entire motion space poses significant difficulties due to the inherent trade-off between accurate lip synchronization and fine-grained emotion control. In this paper, we reveal a key finding: although emotional cues are distributed throughout the motion space, concentrating discriminative supervision on less-principal components achieves a better emotion-lip synchronization balance, as principal components mainly encode high-energy articulation and pose variations. Building on this insight, we propose Xemo-Talker, which first learns a neutral speech-to-motion mapping for stable articulation and lip synchronization, and then introduces a lightweight emotion branch guided by less-principal subspace supervision. To enhance emotion control, we design a Tri-Loss consisting of inter-class separation, intra-class compactness, and less-principal contrastive learning. Given an audio input, a reference image, and an emotion label, Xemo-Talker achieves state-of-the-art emotion classification accuracy while maintaining competitive lip synchronization and high inference efficiency, with performance approaching that measured on real videos.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/chaolongy/Xemo-Talker.
