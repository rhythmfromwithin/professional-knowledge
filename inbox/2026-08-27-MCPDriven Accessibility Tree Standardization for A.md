Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents that interact with graphical user interfaces increasingly rely on either raw screenshots or platform-specific accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs) to perceive interface state. Both approaches have limitations for assistive applications: screenshot-based perception lacks the semantic roles and relationships required by screen readers, while platform-specific APIs such as Windows UI Automation, macOS Accessibility, Android AccessibilityService, and web ARIA require separate integrations for each platform. This paper proposes an architecture that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unified transport and schema layer between heterogeneous accessibility frameworks and LLM-based assistive agents. An MCP accessibility server exposes ARIA-aligned roles, labels, states, and focusable-element hierarchies through a platform-independent representation, enabling consistent interaction across operating systems and applications. The framework also introduces an MCP resource model for persisting user accessibility preferences across sessions. The architecture is analyzed with respect to three research questions: protocol extensibility for accessibility-tree representation, latency and semantic fidelity trade-offs between accessibility trees and screenshot-based perception, and support for persistent accessibility profiles through MCP resources. Rather than presenting an empirical implementation, this work contributes a conceptual framework supported by comparative analysis of accessibility APIs, GUI agent architectures, and the MCP specification. The analysis suggests that a standardized MCP accessibility layer can reduce platform-specific integration complexity while preserving the semantic information required for accessible AI agents, providing a foundation for future implementation and evaluation.
