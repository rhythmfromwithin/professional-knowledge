Abstract: Open-ended image generation is no longer a simple prompt-to-image problem. High-quality generation often requires an agent to combine a model's internal generative ability with external resources. As requests become more diverse and demanding, we aim to develop a general image-generation agent that can self-evolve through trajectories and use tools more effectively across varied generation challenges. To this end, we propose GenEvolve, a self-evolving framework based on Tool-Orchestrated Visual Experience Distillation. In GenEvolve, each generation attempt is modeled as a tool-orchestrated trajectory, where the agent gathers evidence, selects references, invokes generation skills, and composes them into a prompt-reference program. Unlike existing agentic generation methods that mainly rely on image-level scalar rewards, GenEvolve compares multiple trajectories for the same request and abstracts best-worst differences into structured visual experience, provided only to a privileged teacher branch. Inspired by on-policy self-distillation, Visual Experience Distillation provides dense token-level supervision, helping the student internalize better search, knowledge activation, reference selection, and prompt construction. We further construct GenEvolve-Data and GenEvolve-Bench. Experiments on public benchmarks and GenEvolve-Bench show substantial gains over strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance among current image-generation frameworks.
