Abstract: Self-monitoring capabilities -- metacognition, self-prediction, and subjective duration -- are often proposed as useful additions to reinforcement learning agents. But do they actually help? We investigate this question in a continuous-time multi-timescale agent operating in predator-prey survival environments of varying complexity, including a 2D partially observable variant. We first show that three self-monitoring modules, implemented as auxiliary-loss add-ons to a multi-timescale cortical hierarchy, provide no statistically significant benefit across 20 random seeds, 1D and 2D predator-prey environments with standard and non-stationary variants, and training horizons up to 50,000 steps. Diagnosing the failure, we find the modules collapse to near-constant outputs (confidence std < 0.006, attention allocation std < 0.011) and the subjective duration mechanism shifts the discount factor by less than 0.03%. Policy sensitivity analysis confirms the agent's decisions are unaffected by module outputs in this design. We then show that structurally integrating the module outputs -- using confidence to gate exploration, surprise to trigger workspace broadcasts, and self-model predictions as policy input -- produces a medium-large improvement over the add-on approach (Cohen's d = 0.62, p = 0.06, paired) in a non-stationary environment. Component-wise ablations reveal that the TSM-to-policy pathway contributes most of this gain. However, structural integration does not significantly outperform a baseline with no self-monitoring (d = 0.15, p = 0.67), and a parameter-matched control without modules performs comparably, so the benefit may lie in recovering from the trend-level harm of ignored modules rather than in self-monitoring content. The architectural implication is that self-monitoring should sit on the decision pathway, not beside it.
