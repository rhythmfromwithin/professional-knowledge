Abstract: Traditional graph processing systems are built on monolithic servers, which couple a fixed ratio of compute and memory resources but often result in resource under-utilization in data centers. Although the disaggregated memory (DM) architecture has emerged to address this inefficiency, we identify that existing graph processing systems on DM remain highly impractical. They rely on unscalable architectures that fail to scale beyond a single memory node and a single compute node, and they require compute-side caches that are orders of magnitude larger than conventional practice in DM. To this end, this paper presents DMG, the first practical graph processing system on DM, which demonstrates superior system scalability and cache efficiency while delivering high performance. To improve efficiency of graph retrieval on DM, DMG proposes a DM-friendly graph store with retrieval optimizations. To mitigate costly update propagation, DMG presents an adaptive update coordinator that coordinates compute and memory nodes to perform update propagation with low overhead. To enable fast and effective load balancing, DMG employs a two-stage workload manager that includes a coarse-grained initial partitioning and a fine-grained runtime re-scheduling. Experimental results substantiate that compared with the state-of-the-art DM-based graph processing system, DMG can elastically scale up both compute and memory resources, delivering up to 4.9X better performance and accommodating graphs with ever-increasing sizes; meanwhile, it effectively tames the compute-side cache demands by up to 18.9X, positioning itself as a DM-ready solution in practice.
