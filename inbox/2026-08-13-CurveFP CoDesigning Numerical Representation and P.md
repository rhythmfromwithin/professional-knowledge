Abstract: Low-precision formats usually optimize scalar fidelity while inheriting conventional product arithmetic. We introduce CurveFP, a block-scaled family that distributes magnitudes across interleaved logarithmic curves. Uniform curve indices make every nonzero product an exact sign and integer-index update, while a rational radix exposes the finite phase schedule required for accumulation. We instantiate the algebra as CurveFP8 E4C3/E5C2 for training and CurveFP7 E3C3 for compact inference. On four 7B-9B models, CurveFP7 beats tensorwise FP8 perplexity with one fewer element bit and stays within 1.32% of native quality. CurveFP8 lowers error in all 36 paired training-GEMM comparisons. Across three matched 3B-token pretraining triplets, it reaches mean BF16-inference perplexity 22.5366 versus 22.5407 for FP8 and has a lower format penalty in every seed. Downstream evaluation shows transfer parity and a consistent WikiText-103 gain. In a preliminary 4x4 Nangate45 spatial accelerator tile, CurveFP8 uses one fewer product register and 4.6% less area than timing-closing FP8 at 500 MHz. These results support CurveFP as a numerical and arithmetic co-design, while leaving system-level efficiency to future study.
