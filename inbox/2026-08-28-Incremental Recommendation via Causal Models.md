Abstract: Recommendation impressions are a finite resource, hence delivering a recommendation to a user who would discover the content organically yields no incremental value and displaces other recommendations that could. We address this by extending an existing production recommendation model to a causal architecture using holdback data that is already collected as part of routine experimentation infrastructure, requiring no new data collection. A central challenge is that attribution windows differ between treated and holdback observations: treated users are attributed a stream within a short direct-response window, while holdback users are attributed organic streams over a multi-day window. This mismatch makes naive treatment-effect subtraction invalid. We resolve this with a dual-threshold targeting policy that delivers a recommendation only when the probability of a treated stream is high and the probability of organic stream is low. In a production-scale A/B test on millions of Spotify users, this policy reduces recommendation impressions by 7% with no statistically significant reduction in overall recommended content consumption. We further show that joint training with holdback data improves calibration of the treated head relative to the production baseline, and argue this can be taken as evidence that causal models learn more generalisable representations than models trained on observational data alone.
