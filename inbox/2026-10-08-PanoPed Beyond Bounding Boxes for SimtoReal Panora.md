Abstract: Full-sphere panoramic cameras let fixed monitoring systems and mobile robots track people in every direction, but a planar bounding box does not fully describe where a person is on the sphere. We introduce PanoPed, a sim-to-real benchmark for pedestrian tracking on the full sphere. PanoPed-S contains 108,000 frames from fixed, quadruped-mounted, and drone-mounted cameras, with synchronized masks, depth, camera poses, and 3D pedestrian states. PanoPed-R adds 28,002 real frames from fixed cameras, 16,247 of them densely annotated. We find that an ERP rectangle cannot uniquely determine the spherical center and angular extent of the visible person, while the detector's visual query still carries information about them. Inspired by the sextant's use of angular measurements to locate objects, we propose Sextant, a plug-and-play angular localization head with only about 0.035M parameters. It reuses a frozen detector, keeps track identities unchanged, and needs no extra image encoder. Sextant gives the best result in our PanoPed-S test comparison, raising the strongest baseline, MOTIP, from 47.30 to 49.49 HOTA, with gains on all eight test sequences. Without fine-tuning on real data, the same synthetic-trained heads improve MOTIP and HAT by 0.96-1.14 HOTA on real video, and both seeds improve every real sequence. HAT+Sextant scores best among the compared systems that add no localization image encoder.
