Abstract: The development of decision-pretrained transformers, algorithm distillation, long-context meta-RL, and retrieval-augmented agents has renewed interest in in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL): the ability of a pretrained or fine-tuned decision model to infer latent task rules and improve future behavior from interaction context, without test-time parameter updates. This line of work asks when trial-and-error evidence, rewards, transitions, demonstrations, feedback, or retrieved experience can make learning-like computation happen inside the context window. However, existing surveys of ICRL mainly organize the field around pretraining objectives, architectures, context formats, evaluation protocols, and theoretical mechanisms, while the non-stationary setting remains comparatively underexamined. In changing environments, accumulated context is not merely more evidence about a fixed task: the reward specification, transition kernel, observation channel, action interface, constraint model, or demonstration and memory distribution can fall out of alignment with the current regime. Previously useful context can therefore become stale, misleading, or useful again when an old regime returns. We survey non-stationary ICRL as the problem of adapting through context while deployed policy parameters remain fixed: the policy must infer both the current decision rule and which parts of its accumulated evidence still support that rule. We define non-stationary ICRL, relate it to meta-RL, decision sequence modeling, retrieval-augmented RL, value- and model-aware ICRL, and reward-feedback agents, and organize the literature along three questions: what changes, how the change unfolds, and how observable the change is to the agent.
