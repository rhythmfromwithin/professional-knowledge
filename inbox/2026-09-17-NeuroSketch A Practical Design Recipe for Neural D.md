Abstract: Neural decoding is fundamental to brain-computer interfaces, with growing applications in healthcare. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, systematic guidance on architectural design for neural decoding remains limited. In this study, we develop NeuroSketch, a practical design recipe for neural decoding, through a basic architecture study followed by macro- and micro-level optimization. Comparing nine basic architectures, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this backbone, we combine gradual feature-map expansion and early downsampling at the macro level with grouped convolutions at the micro level. These choices form the recipe, which we instantiate as NeuroSketch-Base (1.4M parameters) and NeuroSketch-Large (4.2M parameters). The recipe is developed and evaluated through nearly 5,000 experiments across eight tasks spanning visual, auditory, and speech modalities and EEG, SEEG, and ECoG signals. Against ten baselines, the two variants collectively achieve the best accuracy on each task. Our code is available at https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/NeuroSketch.
