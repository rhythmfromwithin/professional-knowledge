Abstract: We develop spectral algorithms for selecting state-space partitions that define averaging kernels for finite, ergodic and reversible Markov chains. For a partition $\mathcal O$, the Gibbs kernel $G\_{\mathcal O}$ resamples within the current block from the stationary conditional distribution; when this update is tractable, composing or mixing it with a baseline kernel $P$ can accelerate convergence. We select $\mathcal O$ by rounding the bottom nonconstant eigenfunctions of $P^2$, or the algebraically smallest eigenfunctions of $P$ for additive mixtures, using weighted $k$-means. For $F(\mathcal O)=\|G\_{\mathcal O}P-\Pi\|\_{F,\pi}^2$, we derive exact trace and normalized-cut representations and show that $F$ equals the Pearson $\chi^2$-mutual information between the initial block label and the state after one transition, giving this matrix objective a natural probabilistic interpretation. In the two-block case, a threshold sweep exactly solves the associated one-dimensional weighted two-means rounding problem. For general $k \geq 2$, weighted $k$-means rounds the bottom $(k-1)$-dimensional embedding, after which candidates are rescored by $F$; the rounding distortion is a distance between subspaces that yields spectral approximation bounds. We extend the framework to additive mixtures, finite-horizon objectives, and discounted infinite-horizon objectives. In contrast to classical normalized spectral clustering, which uses top nonconstant modes to find low-flow persistent clusters, our method uses bottom modes to favor large normalized cross-block flow and rapid loss of block-label information. Experiments on a controlled-spectrum graph, a mean-field Ising model, and Bayesian variable selection show notable per-iteration improvements in convergence and statistical estimation.
