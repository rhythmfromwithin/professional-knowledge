Abstract: Robots operating in shared workspaces must maintain safe coordination with other agents whose behavior may change during task execution. When a collaborating agent switches strategy mid-episode, continuing under outdated assumptions can lead to unsafe actions and increased collision risk. Reliable detection of such behavioral regime changes is therefore critical. We study regime-switch detection under controlled non-stationarity in ManiSkill shared-workspace manipulation tasks. Across ten detection methods and five random seeds, enabling detection reduces post-switch collisions by 52%. However, average performance hides significant reliability differences: under a realistic tolerance of +-3 steps, detection ranges from 86% to 30%, while under +-5 steps all methods achieve 100%. We introduce UA-TOM, a lightweight belief-tracking module that augments frozen vision-language-action (VLA) control backbones using selective state-space dynamics, causal attention, and prediction-error signals. Across five seeds and 1200 episodes, UA-TOM achieves the highest detection rate among unassisted methods (85.7% at +-3) and the lowest close-range time (4.8 steps), outperforming an Oracle (5.3 steps). Analysis shows hidden-state update magnitude increases by 17x at regime switches and decays over roughly 10 timesteps, while the discretization step converges to a near-constant value (Delta\_t approx 0.78), indicating sensitivity driven by learned dynamics rather than input-dependent gating. Cross-domain experiments in Overcooked show complementary roles of causal attention and prediction-error signals. UA-TOM introduces 7.4 ms inference overhead (14.8% of a 50 ms control budget), enabling reliable regime-switch detection without modifying the base policy.
