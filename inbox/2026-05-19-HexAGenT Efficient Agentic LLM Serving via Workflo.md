Abstract: Agentic LLM applications increasingly execute user requests as multi-step workflows involving planning, tool use, branching, refinement, and synthesis. In such settings, users experience the end-to-end latency of an entire workflow, not the latency of any single LLM call. In this paper, we study how to schedule online agentic workflows across heterogeneous prefill-decode disaggregated LLM serving clusters to efficiently meet workflow-level latency objectives. The problem is challenging because workflow dependencies are revealed incrementally at runtime, calls have heterogeneous prompts, outputs, and KV-cache requirements, and the prefill and decode stages impose different compute, memory, and transfer constraints across heterogeneous GPUs. To solve this problem, we present HexAGenT, a workflow-aware scheduler for a heterogeneous prefill-decode inference service. HexAGenT models each request as an online-revealed DAG, maintains a running estimate of the workflow's standalone completion horizon, prioritizes ready calls by projected risk of missing that horizon, and jointly selects prefill placement, decode placement, and local queue priority while accounting for KV-cache capacity and cross-stage transfer latency. Across representative agentic workloads and heterogeneous A100/H100/H200 clusters, HexAGenT reduces the SLO scale required for timely workflow completion by an average of 20.1% at 95% attainment and 33.0% at 99% attainment, with maximum reductions of 45.0% and 80.5%, respectively.
