Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general capabilities, yet their parameters typically remain fixed after deployment, limiting learning from new interactions. In open-ended environments, this motivates self-evolving agents that continually update reusable state-including model parameters, memories, tool definitions, skills, and workflows-from data, feedback, and accumulated experience. This shift changes the safety problem: once experience becomes reusable state, past events become future causes, and information harmless in one context may later influence decisions with greater persistence, authority, or scope. Self-evolving agent safety therefore asks not only whether a response is aligned or an action authorized, but whether safety properties survive the accumulation, generalization, and cross-context reuse of locally useful experience. We introduce SAVER, a transition-centered framework in which Substrate locates reusable influence, Adaptation captures how it changes, Violation identifies compromised safety attributes, Exposure marks where failures become observable, and Response assesses containment, repair, or revocation. Our survey reveals that failures need not originate from harmful information: legitimate state can become unsafe when adaptation expands its persistence, authority, or scope beyond the conditions under which it was valid. Existing work provides comparatively strong evidence for admission, retrieval, activation, exposure, and local containment, but much less for descendant repair and evaluation after adaptation resumes. We therefore argue for longitudinal evaluation that traces unsafe influence to its originating transition, verifies repair across descendants, and tests whether it can re-emerge under continued evolution.
