Abstract: State-of-charge (SoC) estimation for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft must run on the vehicle under hard energy and certification budgets, on a duty cycle unlike anything in the automotive literature. In this study an event-driven spiking network, the state-estimation core of the nBMS neuromorphic battery management architecture, is designed for per-timestep SoC estimation and evaluated on a public 22-cell eVTOL dataset with an automotive cross-check. A delta and population encoder, a second-order sigma-delta spiking layer, and a rate-accumulator readout hold 34{,}433 int16 parameters with zero dense multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. The estimator reaches 2.45\% root-mean-square error (RMSE) against 1.74\% for a tuned long short-term memory (LSTM) baseline, a gap characterized as a temporal-mixing limit in cruise; in exchange it degrades 1.6 times slower than an adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire control under sensor noise and needs roughly 3{,}500 additions per step where the LSTM needs 67{,}700 multiply-accumulates. The full core is deployed on a low-cost automotive-qualified Artix-7 field-programmable gate array at 87\% block-RAM utilization, meets timing at 50~MHz, and reproduces the frozen fixed-point reference bit-exactly over a real 491-step flight segment on silicon. Fully annotated post-implementation analysis gives 1.30~$\mu$J per inference, an average of 0.65~$\mu$W at the 0.5~Hz mission cadence.
