Abstract: LLM serving systems are provisioned for peak load to meet strict latency targets, leaving substantial GPU compute idle whenever traffic falls below peak. We present DeltaServe, a host-agnostic co-serving design that converts this idle inference capacity into LoRA fine-tuning throughput while preserving inference service-level objectives (SLOs). DeltaServe integrates with existing inference engines through a compact hook interface that requires only multi-LoRA batching support. It exploits the shared execution structure of inference prefill and LoRA fine-tuning forward passes, and uses an SLO-aware scheduler to admit and execute fine-tuning only when sufficient inference headroom is available. The scheduler is driven by a CUDA-graph-aware latency model calibrated offline and refined online. We integrate DeltaServe with vLLM, SGLang, and S-LoRA. On a production trace from Company X, DeltaServe on vLLM delivers 2.9x higher fine-tuning throughput than LLMStation at 100% inference SLO compliance, versus 85% for LLMStation. It also achieves 39% higher fine-tuning throughput than a baseline running vLLM+torchtune, using no additional hardware and maintaining full SLO compliance.
