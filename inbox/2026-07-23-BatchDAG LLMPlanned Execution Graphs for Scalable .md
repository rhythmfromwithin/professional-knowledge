Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at analyzing individual documents but break down on exhaustive, cross-entity analytical questions over enterprise-scale datasets due to context overflow, loss of per-entity attribution, and linear latency from sequential tool calls. We present BatchDAG, a system in which an LLM generates a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) of operations -- SQL queries, semantic searches, in-memory transforms, parallel fan-outs, and single-shot analyses -- which a deterministic engine evaluates with topological-wave parallelism and structured JSON data flow. A key optimization, entity-aware batching, groups rows by logical entity before fan-out, reducing LLM calls by up to 47x. BatchDAG is not primarily an accuracy improvement over hand-optimized pipelines; rather, it is a general-purpose orchestration layer that replaces multiple hand-engineered workflows with a single system that generates the appropriate execution strategy from natural language. In controlled experiments on 12 transcript-heavy queries, BatchDAG (3.74/5) achieves quality comparable to an expert-designed pipeline (3.25/5) and significantly outperforms a ReAct agent (3.09/5, p<0.01), with superior provenance (77% transcript evidence rate vs. 46-60% for baselines). A controlled ablation shows structured JSON intermediates reduce hallucinations by 27% versus prose summaries (paired t-test, p=0.107, n=12). The planner achieves 98.8% valid-DAG rate across 300 planning calls. In production at Brevian.ai, BatchDAG processes queries over 50,000+ meetings in under 60 seconds, with measured per-query costs of $0.02-$0.24 at published GPT-5.1 pricing.
