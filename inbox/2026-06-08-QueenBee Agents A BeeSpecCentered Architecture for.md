Abstract: Enterprise agent systems increasingly need to connect large language models to private tools, internal knowledge, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) interfaces. In this setting, raw task capability is insufficient: organizations also require policy enforcement, tenant-scoped isolation, and execution that remains within explicit operational boundaries. We present Queen-Bee, a governed multi-agent architecture in which a Queen control plane retrieves capabilities, plans task-scoped execution, and compiles a structured BeeSpec that is executed by specialized Bee agents under constrained tool access. We implement a working prototype with tenant-scoped MCP connectors, audit-backed execution-time governance, retrieval-driven weak incubation, and multiple provisioning backends. We evaluate the system on 59 enterprise-style tasks spanning governance-sensitive requests, retrieval-driven provisioning, scoped local execution, and chemistry workflow integration. The retrieval-driven Queen-Bee variant achieves a task success rate of 0.964, zero governance failures, and substantially better scoped execution quality than both a static Queen-Bee baseline and a permissive single-agent baseline. We further show a multi-Bee chemistry workflow with explicit approval gating and a concrete top-3 shortlist grounded in real upstream evidence and screening artifacts. Additional comparisons with hybrid retrieval and LLM-guided provisioning show that richer provisioning backends are viable but do not outperform the lightweight structured retriever on the current small, highly structured capability registry. The results provide prototype-level systems evidence rather than a production deployment study, and suggest that enterprise agent platforms should be evaluated not only by capability, but also by governed provisioning, isolation behavior, scoped execution quality, and artifact-aware workflow coordination.
