### Introduction

Organizations that have been around for a while usually run two identity systems side by side. One belongs to the cloud provider: IAM roles, instance profiles, execution roles. The other is your own, and it is the one your internal services actually check when they decide whether to answer a request.

On infrastructure you build yourself, you can bootstrap your own identity however you like. On managed compute you cannot. The provider hands your process a cloud identity and nothing else.

This post describes how we close that gap for Apache Spark workloads running on Amazon EMR. A workload that starts with only an AWS identity has to end up holding a first-class internal identity. Doing the exchange is straightforward. Making it trustworthy is the part that took the design work. Very little of what follows is specific to Spark or to EMR.

### Two identity systems

Internal service-to-service authentication at Netflix runs on a private PKI called Metatron. Every workload gets a short-lived X.509 certificate, and services authenticate each other with mutual TLS. A workload cannot simply ask for a certificate. It is issued only after the identity service has satisfied itself that the requester really is the workload it claims to be. That verification step is called attestation. In each environment we support (VMs, containers, functions) attestation rests on some environment-specific proof that the platform can check on its own.

The second concept is the Data Project, which is our unit of ownership for data. A Data Project owns tables, has a set of authorized users, and has an identity of its own. Jobs run as the Data Project rather than as the person who launched them. That is what keeps table-level access control and audit consistent across scheduled and interactive use.

So the problem is this. A Spark job on managed compute starts with an AWS execution role and no internal identity. Everything it needs from inside the company (reading an encrypted column, evaluating table ACLs, holding an interactive session open longer than a short-lived token lasts) requires the internal one.

### One identity, one role

The design rests on a decision made outside the Spark stack entirely. Each Data Project identity maps 1:1 to a dedicated IAM role, and the service that owns Data Project metadata records that mapping.

The mapping is what makes translation possible. It lets a statement in the provider’s vocabulary (“*this process is running as role R*”) become a statement in ours (“*this process is workload W*”). Without it there is nothing to translate into, and no amount of cryptography helps. The hard part of bridging two identity systems is rarely the protocol. It is committing to a mapping and then keeping it authoritative.

One practical objection arrives immediately. A single AWS account cannot hold tens of thousands of IAM roles, and we expect data projects in the order of ten thousands. We handled this by sharding data project roles deterministically across a small pool of dedicated accounts, which scales well past the projected number of projects and has the useful side effect of keeping workload roles on the far side of an account boundary from the control planes that launch them.

### Components

Five components take part.

The **control plane** is the only service allowed to launch Spark jobs. It resolves the Data Project’s IAM role, builds and signs a workload metadata payload, and submits the job with that role as the execution role. It holds a signing key issued to it for this purpose alone.

The **Data Project service** is the authority for the identity-to-role mapping.

The **Identity service** receives attestation requests, verifies them, and issues certificates.

A **Spark plugin** provides the hook. Spark 3.0+ added a plugin interface with driver-side and executor-side components that are initialized while those processes are bootstrapping.

**AWS STS** acts as a notary, which is not its usual job.

### Step one: the control plane makes a signed claim

When a job is submitted, the control plane validates the caller, looks up the Data Project’s IAM role, and builds a small payload describing the workload it is about to launch. The payload names the application identity, the mapped role, and the environment, stack and detail that the resulting credentials should be scoped to. The control plane signs the payload and passes it and the signature through as ordinary job configuration.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yKCL4VXtyj7lIYq48yk3fA.png)

Two properties of this step matter. First, only one service can produce a valid signature, so the set of things that can assert “*this workload is legitimate*” is small and auditable. Second, the payload is a claim rather than an authority. On its own it proves nothing, because job configuration travels through infrastructure we do not fully control and anything that can read it can replay it.

### Step two: the workload proves it holds the cloud identity

When the managed service launches the driver process, it does so under an OS user that has the execution role’s credentials available. The driver-side plugin initializes and uses those credentials to sign, but not send, a request to the provider’s identity endpoint (sts:GetCallerIdentity). The result is a short-lived pre-signed URL.

That URL is a transferable proof of possession. Anyone can fetch it. Only the holder of the role’s credentials could have produced it. And the response comes from AWS rather than from the workload, stating which role signed the request. The workload cannot lie about the answer because the workload does not supply the answer.

The pattern is not new. It is the same idea behind AWS IAM authentication in HashiCorp Vault and in AWS’s own function attestation flows. It generalizes well: any environment that gives a process cloud credentials and nothing else can still produce a verifiable statement about its own identity.

The plugin sends one attestation request carrying both artifacts, the pre-signed URL and the signed metadata.

### Step three: corroboration

The identity service does four things.

1. It fetches the pre-signed URL against AWS STS and reads back the role that signed it. This is the provider’s statement.
2. It verifies the metadata signature against the key issued to the control plane. This is the platform’s statement.
3. It corroborates the two. The role AWS reports must be the role the control plane said it dispatched, for the identity the metadata names.
4. It issues certificates for that identity, scoped to the environment, stack and detail from the signed metadata.

Step 3 is the point of the whole design. Neither statement is sufficient by itself, and they fail in complementary ways. The provider’s statement is unforgeable but under-specified: it gives you a role, and a role is not a workload. It says nothing about why this process exists or what it should be allowed to be. The platform’s statement is well-specified but unverifiable on its own, for the reasons above. Put together, the signature says the workload was legitimately dispatched and the pre-signed URL says this really is it. Neither party has to trust the workload’s own account of itself.

There is a tension here that we settled deliberately, and other teams should expect to meet it. The provider’s answer identifies a role, not an application. Deriving an application name from a role name is fragile string matching, and the session identifiers the platform assigns are not under our control. We chose to take the application identity from the signed metadata and use the provider’s answer only for corroboration. That costs a network round trip and a stricter signing requirement, and it buys a much clearer trust story.

### The fan-out problem

A Spark application is one driver and up to thousands of executors, created and destroyed throughout the life of a job. Attestation designed around one process per host does not survive that.

There are two defensible answers.

In the first, each executor attests independently. This is uniform, adds no new trust boundary, and grounds every process’s identity in the same provider-verified proof. The cost is amplification. One large job can produce thousands of STS calls and thousands of attestation requests in a burst, which looks a lot like an attack and creates a hard dependency on provider-side rate limits.

In the second, executors inherit credentials from the driver. The driver attests once and distributes credentials to executors over Spark’s internal RPC, which we configure with authentication and AES-GCM encryption so that only processes in the same application can take part. Load on the identity service stays constant. The cost is a second trust boundary and a driver that is now a credential distribution point.

Considering our scale at Netflix here we went with the second approach. The general lesson is that identity amplification is a capacity question, and it is better to answer it on purpose than to have it answered for you during an incident.

### Lifecycle

Certificates are short-lived by design, so bootstrapping is only half the work. On self-managed hosts a system service handles renewal. Inside managed compute there is no equivalent hook, so the driver JVM runs a timer that re-attests on a fixed interval, well ahead of expiry. Credential material is written to a temporary directory readable only by the process owner and removed when the process exits.

Executors do not refresh. They are usually short-lived, and an executor that somehow outlives its credentials can exit and be replaced, which is cheaper than making every executor a renewal client.

The rule worth carrying into any similar system is that attestation has to be a repeatable operation rather than a bootstrap step. Anything that can only happen once at process start will eventually be the reason a long-running job dies nine hours in.

### Why this generalizes

If you run your own identity system and are moving workloads onto managed compute, the specific services here matter less than the shape of the solution.

1. **Anchor on one exchangeable primitive.** A single authoritative 1:1 mapping between your identity and a provider identity is what makes translation possible. The rest is plumbing.
2. **Require two independent claims and corroborate them.** One from the provider, unforgeable and under-specified. One from your control plane, well-specified and replayable. Trust the intersection and never either alone.
3. **Keep the signer scarce.** If exactly one service can make the platform’s claim, your trust story fits in a sentence.
4. **Hook the layer you still own.** On managed compute you rarely control the host or its init system, but you almost always control the runtime: a plugin, an agent, an entrypoint. Attestation belongs there.
5. **Decide the amplification policy on purpose.** Distributed engines multiply every per-process operation by their parallelism.
6. **Make attestation repeatable and credentials short-lived.** Renewal is a requirement, not a follow-up.

What makes the result trustworthy is that no single participant issues an identity by itself. Not the workload, not the control plane, not the provider. And the workload, which is the party in the weakest position to be trusted, is never asked to vouch for itself.
