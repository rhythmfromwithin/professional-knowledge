Abstract: Transformer-based surrogate models are increasingly used to replace expensive first-principles simulation in engineering design. But conventional transformer architectures are often over parameterized for the small, low-dimensional datasets typical of engineering design spaces, where large simulation data is expensive to generate. Under these conditions, excess parameter capacity leads to overfitting rather than improved accuracy, while also incurring unnecessary memory and compute overhead. This motivates a shift towards architectures that focus on additional compute rather than additional learnable parameters. This paper presents a hardware-aware evaluation of three recursive transformer paradigms for surrogate thermo-mechanical analysis of advanced packages: a)Tiny Recursive Model, b) our proposed Depth Recursive transformer, c) and a simple recursive transformer. We systematically compare their predictive performance (Recall, Mean Reciprocal Rank), parameter count, computational complexity (FLOPs), providing practical design guidelines for selecting recursive transformer architectures under resource-constrained scenarios. We validate this principle on two low-dimensional engineering prediction tasks: 1) thermo-mechanical reliability analysis of advanced semiconductor packages, where stress and warpage from thermal cycling must be evaluated repeatedly across a design-of-experiments sweep under costly finite element analysis (FEA). 2) Laplace PDE iterative numerical solver for capacitance field. Overall, recursive weight-sharing transformers provide an effective and generalizable trade-off between prediction accuracy, parameter efficiency, and computational cost for small data engineering surrogate modeling.
