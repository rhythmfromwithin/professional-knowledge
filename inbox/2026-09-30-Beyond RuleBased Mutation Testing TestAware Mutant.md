Abstract: Mutation testing evaluates test-suite adequacy by injecting synthetic faults into program code. However, traditional rule-based tools often generate large numbers of trivial, redundant, or equivalent mutants that limit their practical use for identifying gaps in a test suite. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches generate more realistic faults, most remain test-blind: The model sees only the source code and cannot reason about what existing tests already cover. We propose test-aware mutant generation, in which an LLM receives the problem statement, canonical solution and base tests in a single prompt, and must generate a nontrivial mutant that passes the base unit tests. We evaluate this approach across a set of five LLMs -- Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, GPT 5.1 Codex Mini, GPT 4.1 Mini, Qwen3-32B -- on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. The extended EvalPlus test suites serve as an automated oracle to verify whether surviving mutants represent genuine bugs. Test-aware prompting yields verified fault rates of 87.7% (HumanEval) and 79.1% (MBPP), meaning these mutants pass all base tests but are caught by the oracle. This vastly outperforms the matched test-blind prompting (which yields only 12.2% and 23.0%, respectively) and the traditional rule-based tool mutmut (4.4% and 5.7%). While fault subtlety (the fraction of extended tests a mutant fails) remains comparable across all three methods, test-awareness minimizes the computational cost per verified fault, compared to test-blind prompting. Exposing an LLM to existing unit tests shifts mutant generation from untargeted bug injection toward effective discovery of weaknesses in an existing test suite. Our work establishes a concrete foundation for future research to scale test-aware mutant generation to production-level environments.
