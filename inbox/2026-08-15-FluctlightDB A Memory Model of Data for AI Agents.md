Abstract: For fifty years, data systems have answered two questions. The relational model asked which records match a predicate; the vector model asked which vectors lie nearest a query. Neither was built for cue-driven, provenance-weighted recall across long sessions. We propose treating long-term agent memory as a distinct data model -- with its own write semantics (encoding, separation, consolidation, provenance) and read semantics (cue-driven activation across a linked memory graph) -- and present FluctlightDB, an embedded engine that implements this contract via experience() and activate(). We make that case carefully, not categorically: we do not claim novelty over Mem0, Zep, or HippoRAG-style memory layers, only an embedded engine contract beneath them. On LoCoMo (official evidence-recall metric; 10 conversations, 1,982 gold spans), CHORUS recalls 99.0% on an internally reproduced July 2026 run. On LongMemEval-S (500 questions, official session\_recall@8), our retrieval harness scores 97.6% (488/500); end-to-end QA with our reader/judge stack scores 97.4% (487/500) -- these layers use different protocols than vendor leaderboard figures we cite for context only. On BEIR SciFact (shared MiniLM embeddings, same harness, Recall Fabric on), CHORUS/PRISM edges Chroma on nDCG@10 (0.646 vs. 0.645) and Recall@10 (0.792 vs. 0.783). We also report a small author-designed regression suite (FAMB; paraphrase n=10, other sub-tests n=1) at 100% macro -- internal validation, not peer benchmark. Strangers can verify the engine in under a minute via pip install "fluctlightdb[native]" and a minimal connect() -> experience() -> activate() script (compiled wheel, not source-only). Harnesses and frozen JSON are MIT-licensed. We claim no new neuroscience and no new transformer; we propose a missing layer of the data stack and release an engine others can reproduce and contest.
