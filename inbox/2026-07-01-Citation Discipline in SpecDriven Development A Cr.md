Abstract: Spec-Driven Development (SDD) frameworks guide Large Language Model (LLM)-powered code generation through formal specifications, yet they differ fundamentally in how they enforce traceability between requirements and generated code. This paper presents two controlled empirical studies comparing three SDD frameworks: $traceSDD$, which enforces mandatory per-line requirement citations using hierarchical REQ-XXX.Y.Z identifiers; $Spec Kit$, which uses artifact-level traceability through user stories and acceptance criteria; and $OpenSpec$, which relies on post-hoc external trace maps. We measure two primary outcomes across two frontier LLMs -- Claude Sonnet 4.6 (N=20, 4 conditions, 240 implementations) and GLM-5-turbo (N=50, 4 conditions, 600 implementations): $output$ $determinism$ (lexical similarity across independent LLM sessions) and $automated$ $hallucination$ $detection$ $rate$ (TDR). Our pre-registered analysis reveals a consistent, cross-model replicated trade-off: the uncited condition produces significantly higher determinism than the cited condition (Claude: $d=-0.76$, $p=0.003$; GLM: $d=-0.72$, $p<0.001$), while only the cited condition enables automated hallucination detection (TDR: Claude 86.4%, GLM 88.0%, vs 0% for all alternatives, FPR=0% across both studies). traceSDD (cited) significantly outperforms $Spec Kit$ on determinism (Claude: $d=0.47$, $p=0.049$; GLM: $d=0.42$, $p=0.003$) but not OpenSpec (Claude: $d=0.18$, $p=0.44$; GLM: $d=0.14$, $p=0.32$). These findings establish that citation annotations trade determinism for verifiability, and that this trade-off generalizes across model architectures.
