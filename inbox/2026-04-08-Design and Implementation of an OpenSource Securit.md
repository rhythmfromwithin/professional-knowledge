Abstract: Misconfiguration, excessive privilege, and tool fragmentation remain the main reasons why enterprise cloud environments are breached. Recent reports on cloud-native application protection note that most incidents can be traced back to configuration or identity errors rather than platform flaws, and that organizations still need separate tools to watch Kubernetes, OpenStack, and infrastructure-as-code. To address this gap, this paper presents an open-source cloud-infrastructure security framework built with a microservice architecture. The framework integrates four core services: 1) identity and access control unification, 2) configuration-baseline intelligent checking over Kubernetes and OpenStack assets, 3) real-time threat monitoring based on Falco-style runtime rules and ELK-based analytics, and 4) automated remediation that consumes Terraform plans and Checkov/OPA policy results to roll back or harden resources. It provides automated deployment, supports 50-200-node clusters, and exposes uniform REST and gRPC interfaces for extension. In an enterprise-grade testbed, vulnerability-assessment time was reduced from 120 min as baseline toolchain to 18 min, with false-positive rate below 5%. After continuous deployment, the number of observable security events dropped by 62%. The project is released under Apache 2.0 to lower entry cost by about 40% for small and medium teams.
