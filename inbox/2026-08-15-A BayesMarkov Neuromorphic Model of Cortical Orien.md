Abstract: The emergence of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a central question in computational neuroscience. Shirazi's Bayes-Markov model proposed a probabilistic explanation for how orientation-selective inhibition can arise from non-oriented lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) inputs through local inference. In that formulation, the activity pattern of striate cortical inhibitory (SCI) cells is estimated from the LGN activity pattern by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion over a two-layer hierarchical Markov random field, and the resulting inference is implemented through a local parallel relaxation algorithm. We provide a computationally explicit re-implementation and quantitative simulation study of this framework. We reconstruct the mathematical model, describe its fully LGN-driven update rule, and implement a vectorized simulation framework that preserves the original local clique operations while making systematic parameter sweeps feasible. We evaluate the model using orientation tuning curves, an orientation selectivity index (OSI), controlled LGN noise perturbations, contrast tests, and model-variant comparisons. We further add a spiking SCI-layer realization using leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley neurons to examine whether the rate-coded SCI field can be expressed through temporally explicit neural activity. The simulations support the central qualitative behavior of the Bayes-Markov framework: sharp orientation selectivity, robustness to moderate LGN noise, and a biologically interpretable proof-of-concept spiking realization of the inferred inhibitory field.
