Abstract: There is no doubt that safety alignment is an essential step in LLM training. However, conceptually it does not distinguish between various domains and the level of potential harm of a query, which creates significant complications in the fields like cyber security, where a model should not be constrained by its safety circuits to accomplish the goals of legitimate, authorized operations. In this work, we share our findings from a large scale abliteration experiment on 24 open-source LLMs and show that domain-specific abliteration is achievable with standard methodology on the example of a 1T-parameter Kimi K2. Building on recent work showing that refusal in LLMs occupies a multi-dimensional subspace within layers, we find that it is also distributed widely across layers, especially in trillion-parameter MoE architectures, and so we aim to capture the part of it that represents harmful concepts in the cybersecurity domain exclusively. We also investigate the correlation between models' features and the effect of domain-specific abliteration, identifying that the type of safety training and architecture are the most reliable predictors. Finally, we classify the models into 3 abliteration susceptibility tiers and put forward a set of conjectures as to why a particular effect from this intervention might be observed in a given model.
