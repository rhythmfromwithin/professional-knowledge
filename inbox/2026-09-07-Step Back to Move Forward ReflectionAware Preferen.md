Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream paradigm for modern visual generation and have substantially advanced multimedia content synthesis, especially in text-to-image and text-to-video tasks. To further align such generative models with human preferences, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown strong potential as a post-training strategy. Nevertheless, existing policy gradient-based methods often explore inefficiently, making them vulnerable to local optima that may degrade semantic faithfulness and visual realism. To address these challenges, we present Reflection-Aware GRPO (RA-GRPO), a new RL-based preference alignment framework for diffusion generative models. The core idea is to improve "forward" generation by incorporating "backward" reflection during optimization. We first introduce Diffusion Reflection, which rectifies intermediate sampling trajectories by inverting the diffusion process with a weak estimator, guiding latent states toward higher-probability regions of the true data manifold. Furthermore, we introduce Counterfactual Path Synthesis to implicitly distill these rectified trajectories into the policy, enabling the model to internalize the benefits of search-based exploration without incurring inference-time overhead. Extensive experiments on T2I and T2V models demonstrate that RA-GRPO significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in mitigating reward hacking and improving generalization. The method remains architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with standard pipelines, suggesting a promising direction for stable preference alignment.
