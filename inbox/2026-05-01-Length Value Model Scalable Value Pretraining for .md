Abstract: Token serves as the fundamental unit of computation in modern autoregressive models, and generation length directly influences both inference cost and reasoning performance. Despite its importance, existing approaches lack fine-grained length modeling, operating primarily at the coarse-grained sequence level. We introduce the Length Value Model (LenVM), a token-level framework that models the remaining generation length. By formulating length modeling as a value estimation problem and assigning a constant negative reward to each generated token, LenVM predicts a bounded, discounted return that serves as a monotone proxy for the remaining generation horizon. This formulation yields supervision that is annotation-free, dense, unbiased, and scalable. Experiments on LLMs and VLMs demonstrate LenVM provides a highly effective signal at inference time. On the LIFEBench exact length matching task, applying LenVM to a 7B model improves the length score from 30.9 to 64.8, significantly outperforming frontier closed-source models. Furthermore, LenVM enables continuous control over the trade off between performance and efficiency. On GSM8K at a budget of 200 tokens, LenVM maintains 63% accuracy compared to 6 percent for token budget baseline. It also accurately predicts total generation length from the prompt boundary. Finally, LenVM's token-level values offer an interpretable view of generation dynamics, revealing how specific tokens shift reasoning toward shorter or longer regimes. Results demonstrate that LenVM supports a broad range of applications and token length can be effectively modeled as a token-level value signal, highlighting the potential of LenVM as a general framework for length modeling and as a length-specific value signal that could support future RL training.
