Abstract: The European Patent Office (EPO) reported record filings in 2025, and the 2026 EPO Guidelines hold applicants strictly responsible for LLM-assisted content under Article 83 and Rule 42, creating pressure to triage suspected AI-generated patent text. Two constraints make this hard. First, realistic prosecution settings often have only consumer GPUs with about 8 GB VRAM, not datacenter-class scoring stacks. Second, Article 84 of the European Patent Convention requires claims to be clear and concise, pushing human drafting onto the same low-perplexity, low-burstiness manifold that LLMs occupy. We benchmark three open-source zero-shot detectors on 500 granted EPO H04 telecom patents versus 500 LLM-generated counterparts using five prompting strategies, all under the consumer hardware envelope. At claim level, all detectors exceed 60 percent false-positive rate: Binoculars 78.3 percent, Fast-DetectGPT 61.3 percent, DetectGPT 80.5 percent. The failure persists under Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct regeneration, LoRA-adapted Pythia-2.8B scoring heads, cross-IPC replication on A61K, C07D, and F03D (mean FPR 84.6 percent), and H100 re-evaluation with published Falcon-7B and GPT-J-6B heads, arguing the issue is structural rather than substitute-model capacity. A seven-feature linguistic-complexity logistic regression reaches 74.0 percent accuracy at 28.1 percent FPR, a 13 percentage-point gain over a perplexity-only baseline at a comparable operating point, without using likelihood at inference and within the same hardware budget.
