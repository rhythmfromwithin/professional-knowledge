Abstract: Domestic robots rely on rich perception to operate in private homes, but privacy risk persists even when raw sensor data remain local. Structured representations exported to downstream planners, cloud services, logs, or learning pipelines can still reveal household information through semantics, geometry, spatial structure, and task targets. We introduce Task-Functional Perception Distillation (TFPD), a task-scoped representation-export framework that keeps rich perception local and profiles downstream exports according to task utility, direct exposure, and multiple residual inference risks. Using 120 AI2-THOR scenes with scene-disjoint train/validation/test splits, frozen attacker selection, and representation-aware held-out attacks, we evaluate navigation, collision checking, and object-goal execution. Three navigation exports achieve identical success (1.000) and mean path ratio (0.898), yet representation-level linkability ranges from 0.532 to 0.970. Replacing an explicit target label with a target region reduces target-category macro-F1 from 1.000 to 0.077 while preserving success at 0.995, while geometric coarsening reduces object-category macro-F1 from 0.704 to 0.556 at a measurable collision-utility cost. A ProcTHOR replication preserves the navigation task-equivalence/privacy-inequivalence finding while changing the relative ordering of normalized and topological exports. These results show that neither field removal nor stronger abstraction induces a universal privacy ordering and motivate task-specific, multi-risk evaluation of the complete public representation.
