Abstract: Neuroevolution is a representative neural architecture search paradigm that evolves both network topology and weights through evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we propose Seq103, a unified NEAT-style neuroevolution framework for compact sequence architecture discovery. Seq103 consists of a shared evolutionary backbone and an optional recurrent extension. The shared backbone includes an elementary node-and-connection representation, per-class RMSE-based evaluation, mutation-based evolution with class-wise recombination, and elitism. The optional hidden-state mechanism extends the search space with hidden-state nodes and hidden connections, enabling temporal memory when step-wise recurrent inference is required. With this design, Seq103 applies the same core search pipeline to both step-wise recurrent and sample-wise feedforward sequence classification. In recurrent tasks, the hidden-state extension is enabled to provide temporal memory; in feedforward tasks, it is disabled while the shared evolutionary backbone remains unchanged. We evaluate Seq103 on 8 text classification datasets and the full UCRArchive2018 benchmark with 128 univariate time-series datasets. On step-wise tasks, Seq103 retains 86.96% of the best-baseline accuracy on average while using 34.6x to 3218.0x fewer parameters. On sample-wise tasks over the full UCRArchive2018 benchmark, Seq103 retains 81.95% of the best-baseline accuracy on average while using 11.8x to 160,601.0x fewer parameters.
