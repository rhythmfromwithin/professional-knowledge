Abstract: Function-calling agents -- large language models that invoke tools and APIs -- require high-quality, domain-specific training data spanning executable environments, backing databases, and diverse multi-turn trajectories. We introduce EigenData, an integrated, self-evolving platform that automates the full data lifecycle through a multi-agent architecture. A top-level orchestrator, EigenCore, coordinates three specialized sub-systems: DatabaseAgent for realistic domain database construction, CodingAgent for verified executable environment generation with iterative test-debug loops, and DataAgent for multi-turn trajectory synthesis with self-evolving prompt optimization. Cross-component feedback ensures consistency across all artifacts. We apply EigenData to audit and repair the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL-V3), identifying systematic errors in function schemas, implementations, and reference trajectories, automatically correcting them through coordinated schema refinement, code-level bug fixes, and trajectory modification, and introducing an outcome-aware evaluation protocol that assesses task success via database-state correctness rather than turn-level trajectory matching. We demonstrate that the repaired benchmark, coupled with outcome-aware metrics, produces model rankings substantially better correlated with human judgments of functional correctness.
