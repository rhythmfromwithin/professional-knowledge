Abstract: As services move online, trust institutions such as banks, lenders, and governments must verify the identity of remote users. Fraud detection tools are widely available, but evaluating and fine-tuning them remains difficult because identity documents are sensitive and therefore scarce. Synthetic data generation offers a path forward, and demand is clear: our prior work in this area has been downloaded over $11{,}000$ times (aggregated from eight parts). We introduce IDSpace, extending this line of research in three directions. First, we propose model-guided Bayesian optimization, which tunes generation parameters to maximize both visual similarity and prediction consistency with target-domain models given only a few samples from a target domain. Second, we decouple user-specified metadata (demographics, fraud patterns, capture device) from automatically tuned control parameters (font styles, noise levels, image quality), allowing users to configure evaluations without low-level expertise. Third, we expand beyond template images to support scanned and mobile-captured documents. Experiments show IDSpace improves evaluation consistency by $15-45\%$ over baselines including CycleGAN, diffusion inpainting, and non-guided optimization, using only a few real samples, while improving training accuracy by up to $9\%$ and SSIM similarity with the target domain by $10\%$. We also released a new dataset consisting of $359{,}240$ high-quality synthetic documents across ten European ID types.
