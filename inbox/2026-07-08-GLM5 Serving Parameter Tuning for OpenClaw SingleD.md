Abstract: OpenClaw requests are dominated by long, tool-augmented prefixes, including system prompts, conversation history, and tool outputs fed back into the context window. For this workload, with about 28k-30k input tokens and 500 output tokens per request, serving quality is governed by throughput, TTFT, and tail latency rather than short-prompt throughput alone.
This report studies GLM-5 serving-parameter tuning within a MaaS multi-model inference optimization architecture. The scope is the Single-Node Optimization block of the inference-optimization layer, where chunked prefill, tensor parallelism (TP), pipeline parallelism (PP), and request concurrency are tuned for one GLM-5 serving deployment; in this report, "Single-Node Optimization" denotes the architecture block, while experiments run on a two-node, sixteen-GPU cluster.
Within the tested space, the best configuration is chunked-prefill-size=3072, tp=4, pp-size=4, and max-running-requests=24. Compared with the conservative 2048/4/4/16 baseline, it increases request throughput from 0.43 to 0.48 req/s and total token throughput from 9029.64 to 9993.23 tok/s, while reducing average TTFT from 8.98 to 6.69 s and latency P90 from 40.23 to 32.64 s. Under the same hardware footprint, this corresponds to an estimated 10.4% lower serving cost per request and 9.6% lower cost per token. The results show that the optimum is workload-specific: larger chunk sizes and deeper queueing do not monotonically improve performance. We therefore recommend 3072 / tp4 / pp4 / max24 as the default OpenClaw deployment profile.
